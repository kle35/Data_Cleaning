kcd,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).
Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:
- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.
- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.
- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.
- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.
- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.
- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.
- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.
- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).
Listening impressions:
- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).
- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).
- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.
- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.
- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.
Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.",Verified Purchase,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023"
Bast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.
If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.
RE: Small heads
Your head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.
When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:
- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)
- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all
- then gently fitting headband
Once I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.
Of note and Re:Sensitive Temples
These do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.
The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.
RE: Hair
Y'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.
The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.
So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.
Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):
These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is icing on the cake.

Richard Huynh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.
Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.
Pros:
Comfortable and lightweight!
I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.
Unique features
Noise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.
Superb sound!
The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.
Fast charging!
The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes! I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.
Cons:
Cost.
Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!
Fitment.
They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.
Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.
Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.
Conclusion.
Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!
Personal opinionated review:
Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones.

mhans311,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.
Comfort
The XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.
Sound Quality
This is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.
Call Quality
I use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.
Noise Cancellation
I mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.
Build Quality and Design
This is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.
Battery Life
The battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.
Odds and Ends
Features of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.
Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.",Verified Purchase,41 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023"
Fresh and Felicia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.
The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.
With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.
No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.
A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.
There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.
With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.
And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.
The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.
But – how do they sound?
Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.
The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.
I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.
And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.
And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.
The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!
Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.
So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.",Verified Purchase,768 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2022"
Worm,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright.

Laurent Park,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this looking for a replacement for my AirPod Pros -- I would use them for work calls and for listening. My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.
So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC. I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.
So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:
Pros:
- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening. These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I am able to last a full 8 hour office job wearing these without too much sweat or heat, and the pressure is perfect. No headaches from wearing them all day, and it's overall been absolutely perfect. In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.
- Battery life / charging is amazing. 30 hours may be the industry standard but whenever I'm low, I just give it a charge for five minutes and I'm basically good for the next few hours.
Cons:
- I listen to a variety of music from hip hop and mostly electronic music. For songs with more emphasis on acoustics and vocals, the headphones are pretty good. However for my electronic library it leaves a bit to be desired. The bass and sometimes mids feel very muddy, and no amount of EQ I use can get it to where I like for all my music. This is where AirPods Maxes shine out. They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.
- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all. You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023"
Miki Villarreal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been looking for some good over the ear headphones and seen so many good reviews of these. I decided to try them out and these are some amazing head phones! I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!
Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.
Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on. Even when the headphones were off it did an amazing job of damping outside noise. Ex: I was by a VERY loud construction site and once I put on the headphones (turned off) it almost dampened the noise completely.
Ambient Mode: It’s nice, I will say that in some cases I didn’t really use it. For example if you are in a loud environment it will be extremely loud while on. Which makes sense as the point of AMB is to be aware of your surroundings but if you have sensory issues I would be mindful of it. When you do the quick ambient sound it’s really good and makes what you need to hear very clear. There is very little static noise but if you are listening closely it’s very faint.
Comfort: These are so comfortable and lightweight. Part of the reason I was having difficulty choosing over the ear headphones was because many were too heavy for my liking but when I wore these I forgot I had them on. I only had to adjust them once when it hit closer to the 5 hour mark. There is very little discomfort. My only thing is being that they are so light it feels like they can slip off easily sometimes. When you have them laying on your neck it can be a little uncomfortable at least for me. They landed on my collarbones so there was just hard plastic hitting my collarbones over a bit of time. But that is just me nit picking.
Few set backs: the storage of them is a little inconvenient or undesirable. I wish these could fold because the case is quite large and take ups a lot of space especially when you are traveling.
Overall: I have really enjoyed the experience with these headphones! I would really recommend these to someone who has auditory sensitivity like myself because they check a lot of boxes! There are only a few things that I wasn’t a huge fan of but that was like I said me nit picking.

Brandi J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went ahead and splurged on these around 3 to 6 months ago after I stepped on my XM3s in the dark and cracked the band mechanism. I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.
Funny story.. I thought the noise-canceling was just kind of mediocre this whole time, especially when I was flying back from visiting my parents and using them on a plane. The trick is to quickly press the second button toward the back on the left earpiece to activate noise-canceling. It was like the angels sang when I did that.. suddenly the music was so clear and rich, the plane noises virtually eliminated. Duh. So if you own these or are thinking about it, don't forget that tip!
As I mentioned, I've owned the older XM3 model for quite a few years now and loved them; these XM5s are even better and I love them for all music listening occasions. They're a little bassier than the XM3s, definitely a step further on that front. I happen to like bass (not muddied, just ""full"" and well-rounded), and these deliver. The highs and mids never seem to suffer either, though! A lot of it depends on fooling with your app's EQ settings, too. So don't be afraid to experiment!
Great headphones and, if you have the money to splurge, they're worth it!

I have used these every day since buying them 5 months ago - at the gym, at home, for work calls, etc. and they have met all my expectations. The noise canceling is fantastic, almost too good sometimes. The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them).

Might not be something you want to do intense jumping or HIIT workouts in, since they do move around a bit - but that goes for ALL over ear headphones. Running with them on was no problem.
When looking to make an investment in a pair of headphones I went in-person to Best Buy and tried these compared to the Apple Air Max and these won by a long shot. Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the ""it-girl"" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better. Only thing I agree with is they are a finger-print magnet but be good about cleaning your devices and its not an issue. The volume control / change song features on the ear cups is also something that takes some getting use to but I use my phone or apple watch to change those settings anyways so I don't find it to be an issue that impacts its quality.
Overall, would recommend to anyone.",Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2023"
LilOlMe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is steep but the performance and sound quality is outstanding. I've tried many headsets recently and none were able live up to the advertised hype. I recently returned to an office environment and have desperately needed to find something that could silence the endless chatter and sweep me away into a personal bubble of music. Ear buds fall out, leak sound and fail to provide adequate noise cancellation. Headsets are better but most can't deliver every aspect that most people want. Comfort, hours of use, excellent sound, touch features, noise cancellation, no external sound leakage, ease of use.... the list goes on... The Sony WH 1000XM5 delivers on all of this and more. When I finally decided to order it my stomach was in knots over the money I had just spent and I was certain I'd try it, realize it wasn't worth it and promptly return it. Wow...was I wrong. It literally blew me away. I've had it for 48 hours now and been at work for 18 of them. 18 hours of pure chatter free bliss in my beautiful bubble of music. I also played a couple movies to listen to in the background and I felt like I was in a theater. The only thing missing was the popcorn. I tend to be very careful when I make any purchase that has such a steep price to pay but I have to admit that I got ""exactly"" what I paid for and without one iota of regret. If you can work this in your budget it's well worth it.

Bowie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven’t had them for long since I only got them in December during the sale, but so far I love them.
Aesthetics - the white/grey ones are so pretty! So glad I picked these over the black ones.
Comfort - most days I have no problem with having them on for 6-8 hrs (my ears don’t hurt at all, sometimes I forget that I have headphones on), but occasionally idk what it is they feel slightly less comfy. I probably just need to figure out how to adjust them still. Either way it doesn’t really bother me. Also after 6-8 hrs of wearing my ears are not sweaty/there’s no condensation in the cups.
Battery life - superb, 10-15% drain per 8 hrs like what everyone says. Charges quickly.
Sound - I’m not into headphones and know nothing about sound quality but I like what I hear with these after playing with eq.
Operation - speak to chat doesn’t always work but when it does it’s amazing. Taking off headphones sometimes doesn’t pause music for me either. I wish these functions are more consistent and reliable but as they are I can deal.
Prior experiences - I’ve pretty much only used headphones that came with Apple devices then AirPods pro. I have not ever owned a proper pair of headphones and got these sonys for function. I liked my AirPods pro enough but I can’t wear them at once for more than 2 hrs, they tend to irritate my ears and slip out after that.
Again, so far overall quite happy with my Sonys. Probably won’t pay $400 for them tho.",Verified Purchase,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023"
RobertJfjg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only worn these headphones for a 10 hour flight to my destination and back, but these headphones far surpassed my expectations. They truly cancelled out the airplane noise and I didn’t have to blast the volume to do that. My headphones were set to about the middle volume setting with noise cancelling turned on and I could not hear any of the airplane noise. My music and videos were clear the entire flight. My ears did get a little warm near the end, but I also have smaller ears and head, the headphones were the smallest they would go so this may have been the reason why my ears got a tad hot.

Katie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall these are great headphones. The sound quality is amazing for my unprofessional ear. I bought these not only to listen to music/watch movies but for working remote and taking phone calls in noisy settings. They do an amazing job at blocking out noise including wind. I ordered these and a pair of Oro Sound Tild Pro headset and these outperformed the tild pro which had an actual boom mic and has amazing reviews for noise cancellation in the microphone. The only noise the Sonys still pick up is some kids screaming but that’s understandable. It blocked out a blender, wind, etc. The only two complaints I would have is for phone call quality there’s a slight Bluetooth lag which is normal for all Bluetooth headsets/earbuds and they don’t do a good job and bringing your own voice into the phone call to where I’m unable to tell if I’m yelling into the phone or not. Other than that they’re great. Oh also the headband tends to start hurting within 30 minutes but that’s a common theme for all headsets for me so I don’t believe that’s an issue with the Sonys rather my head is sensitive.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2023"
Brocjames,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not a huge audiophile so I’m not going to bore you with a bunch nerd audio stuff. I’ve had these headphones for a couple weeks and I couldn’t be happier. Even with the $350 gut punch. First the ANC is the best I’ve ever encountered. I’m a machinist and work 11-12 hours in a machine shop with lots of machines making lots of noise. I put these cans on and suddenly I’m immersed in the quietest of libraries. Features like the speak to chat and cupping your hand over the right can to pause the music and instantly hear ambient noise. I was skeptical and thought they might be a gimmick. Boy was I wrong they quickly became an invaluable part of these headphones, as I mostly use them at work. Not having to constantly move one can to the side constantly to converse with a coworker or listen to something important is the pinnacle of convenience. The app is also incredibly useful. It has an equalizer and allows you to customize the amount of ambient sound that comes through. As I said I’m not a big audio nerd but the sound quality is the best I’ve experienced in any headphones and I own more than a few pairs. I forgot to mention they are incredibly comfortable. I can wear them my entire 11 hour shift no problem.
I’ll add to this review as I use them. So far, the only main drawback is the lack of water resistance.",Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2023"
kbs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, if I were reading the following review I wouldn’t believe it so I’ll understand if you don’t. I’ve been a lifelong audiophile (meaning its my hobby) for about 40 years. Like everyone else, i’ve been into high-end headphones and high-rez audio for the last decade or so. I bought these because I had a gift card to spend and I wanted to get a full-size set of cans wit great noise cancelling (better than my airpod pro’s). Wasn’t really interested in audio - after all, I have a collection of high-end cans, IEM’s and CIEM;s to pick from. This includes Sennheiser HD-650, B&W P7, Phillips Fidelio X2. For IEM’s Shure SE535 & Westone UM50SE, for CIEM JH Audio J13 v2. All fed high-rez files through a JDS El Dac & Schiit Asgard II. So not super high end, but definitely not mid-Fi either. All of the above COMPLETELY, utterly blow away my AirPod pro’s and a pair of Sony Bluetooth extra bass cans (the 900’s) that I got just to indulge my bass-head moods. What I most certainly didn’t even remotely expect was that I would actually like the WH-1000XM5’s for music (considering what I already have). Surprise, surprise. These are AWESOME!!! Fed with the same high-rez files I use for my high-end system (which of course don’t get to the drivers as high-rez because it’s just crappy Bluetooth), I am shocked to say that I actually like this BETTER!!! Maybe I’ve just lost my mind, but yes, I actually prefer these to anything else I have. Any audiophile knows the experience of when you get something that noticeably steps up your sound, you can’t help but go through your whole music collection to re-listen to everything because now its better. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing since these showed up. I am dumbfounded. I don;t know what it is - maybe its the crafty AI they are using in the DDSSE (or whatever they call it), but this is the most open, detailed, liquid, textured, etc. sound I have. And that’s just streaming Apple Music HD and Amazon Music HD through an iPhone! No amp. No DAC. No fancy silver cables.

D'Ante,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The XM5 is a very good set of over-ear headphones. I even own the WF-1000XM4 buds. They’re Both really good and are great across the board but I also own B&W PX7 S2’s. The equalizer is great for the Sony but they seem to be missing some of the detail that I hear from the PX7 S2s. The technology that Sony has in the XM5s is light years ahead of many others that I’ve tried but ultimately SQ is the most important thing for me. I am honestly not a fan of active ANC unless traveling for business which is far less often these days but I am a techie and love the location and profile switching features. I believe for most, the XM5s will check all necessary boxes but for your own sake, do not listen to PX7 S2s if you can avoid them. Lol. Same goes for the B&W PI7 buds. Neither B&W set has a true eq (bass and treble only) but the sound is very good out of the box so I really didn’t mind.

kcd,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).
Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:
- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.
- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.
- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.
- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.
- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.
- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.
- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.
- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).
Listening impressions:
- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).
- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).
- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.
- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.
- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.
Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.",Verified Purchase,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023"
Bast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.
If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.
RE: Small heads
Your head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.
When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:
- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)
- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all
- then gently fitting headband
Once I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.
Of note and Re:Sensitive Temples
These do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.
The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.
RE: Hair
Y'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.
The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.
So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.
Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):
These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is icing on the cake.

Richard Huynh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.
Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.
Pros:
Comfortable and lightweight!
I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.
Unique features
Noise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.
Superb sound!
The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.
Fast charging!
The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes! I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.
Cons:
Cost.
Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!
Fitment.
They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.
Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.
Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.
Conclusion.
Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!

mhans311,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.
Comfort
The XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.
Sound Quality
This is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.
Call Quality
I use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.
Noise Cancellation
I mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.
Build Quality and Design
This is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.
Battery Life
The battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.
Odds and Ends
Features of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.
Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.",Verified Purchase,41 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023"
Fresh and Felicia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.
The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.
With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.
No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.
A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.
There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.
With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.
And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.
The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.
But – how do they sound?
Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.
The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.
I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.
And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.
And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.
The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!
Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.
So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.",Verified Purchase,768 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2022"
Worm,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced.

Laurent Park,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this looking for a replacement for my AirPod Pros -- I would use them for work calls and for listening. My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.
So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC. I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.
So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:
Pros:
- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening. These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I am able to last a full 8 hour office job wearing these without too much sweat or heat, and the pressure is perfect. No headaches from wearing them all day, and it's overall been absolutely perfect. In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.
- Battery life / charging is amazing. 30 hours may be the industry standard but whenever I'm low, I just give it a charge for five minutes and I'm basically good for the next few hours.
Cons:
- I listen to a variety of music from hip hop and mostly electronic music. For songs with more emphasis on acoustics and vocals, the headphones are pretty good. However for my electronic library it leaves a bit to be desired. The bass and sometimes mids feel very muddy, and no amount of EQ I use can get it to where I like for all my music. This is where AirPods Maxes shine out. They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.
- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all. You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023"
Miki Villarreal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been looking for some good over the ear headphones and seen so many good reviews of these. I decided to try them out and these are some amazing head phones! I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!
Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.
Noise cancellation: It was really good and didn’t create too much pressure while on. Even when the headphones were off it did an amazing job of damping outside noise. Ex: I was by a VERY loud construction site and once I put on the headphones (turned off) it almost dampened the noise completely.
Ambient Mode: It’s nice, I will say that in some cases I didn’t really use it. For example if you are in a loud environment it will be extremely loud while on. Which makes sense as the point of AMB is to be aware of your surroundings but if you have sensory issues I would be mindful of it. When you do the quick ambient sound it’s really good and makes what you need to hear very clear. There is very little static noise but if you are listening closely it’s very faint.
Comfort: These are so comfortable and lightweight. Part of the reason I was having difficulty choosing over the ear headphones was because many were too heavy for my liking but when I wore these I forgot I had them on. I only had to adjust them once when it hit closer to the 5 hour mark. There is very little discomfort. My only thing is being that they are so light it feels like they can slip off easily sometimes. When you have them laying on your neck it can be a little uncomfortable at least for me. They landed on my collarbones so there was just hard plastic hitting my collarbones over a bit of time. But that is just me nit picking.
Few set backs: the storage of them is a little inconvenient or undesirable. I wish these could fold because the case is quite large and take ups a lot of space especially when you are traveling.
Overall: I have really enjoyed the experience with these headphones! I would really recommend these to someone who has auditory sensitivity like myself because they check a lot of boxes! There are only a few things that I wasn’t a huge fan of but that was like I said me nit picking.

Brandi J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went ahead and splurged on these around 3 to 6 months ago after I stepped on my XM3s in the dark and cracked the band mechanism. I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.
Funny story.. I thought the noise-canceling was just kind of mediocre this whole time, especially when I was flying back from visiting my parents and using them on a plane. The trick is to quickly press the second button toward the back on the left earpiece to activate noise-canceling. It was like the angels sang when I did that.. suddenly the music was so clear and rich, the plane noises virtually eliminated. Duh. So if you own these or are thinking about it, don't forget that tip!
As I mentioned, I've owned the older XM3 model for quite a few years now and loved them; these XM5s are even better and I love them for all music listening occasions. They're a little bassier than the XM3s, definitely a step further on that front. I happen to like bass (not muddied, just ""full"" and well-rounded), and these deliver. The highs and mids never seem to suffer either, though! A lot of it depends on fooling with your app's EQ settings, too. So don't be afraid to experiment!
Great headphones and, if you have the money to splurge, they're worth it!

Blayre C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're thinking about buying a pair of great over-ear headphones without jumping on the air max ""trendy"" bandwagon, then you found them. These are FANTASTIC. I have used these every day since buying them 5 months ago - at the gym, at home, for work calls, etc. and they have met all my expectations. The noise canceling is fantastic, almost too good sometimes. The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them). I wear them to the gym to weightlift and sweat a normal amount, and have had no issues so far. Might not be something you want to do intense jumping or HIIT workouts in, since they do move around a bit - but that goes for ALL over ear headphones. Running with them on was no problem.
When looking to make an investment in a pair of headphones I went in-person to Best Buy and tried these compared to the Apple Air Max and these won by a long shot. Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the ""it-girl"" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better. Only thing I agree with is they are a finger-print magnet but be good about cleaning your devices and its not an issue. The volume control / change song features on the ear cups is also something that takes some getting use to but I use my phone or apple watch to change those settings anyways so I don't find it to be an issue that impacts its quality.

One complaint: It takes a lot of space. Unlike some headphones, it only folds flat (instead of folding in).

Alex,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.
I originally owned a pair of Bose 700 so my comparison is against them.
Build
The build of the MX5 is on par with the 700s. They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.
The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load. The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.
The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.
The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.
Noise Cancelling
I won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic. I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.
Extra Settings
The app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.
The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like ""Noise Cancelling 5"" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through. I'd like to be optimistic and say that sony can adjust these features later but they don't appear to be in the habit of adding features to the app. I also own a pair of the XM4s which are the in noise canceling headphones and I haven't notice anything new in the app since I got them.",Verified Purchase,29 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022"

Out of the box, the sound quality on these cans is decent but the headphones are more bass-heavy. The low end sounds a little “muddy”. There is an EQ adjustment in the accompanying Sony app, but after downloading it, quickly uninstalled it because the software demanded a lot of personal information. We'd rather rather live with the just-tolerable sound profile than give up all that information to Sony.

Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though, is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking.

Nagisa11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.
Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.
The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).
The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.
The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.
Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.
The issues:
I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.
The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.
The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.

Anna Skenadore,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for a little over a month now and have run into many problems. I use my headphones constantly so I needed something that would be able to have good audio quality, good call sound, good noise cancelling and somewhat functional. I really wanted to like these but unfortunately there were too many problems I ran into that weren’t user error or miseducation.
1. The adjustable ear pieces don’t stay. - I tend to readjust these everyday. They slide out further and further until they fall off my head no matter the activity I’m doing.
2. The touch controls are too sensitive. - This one I’m not sure if it’s just me, but I go through bouts of my headphones pausing/playing my music, activating Siri, turning the volume up and down all while not actually touching them. This tends to happen very fast as if water or something else were touching it. It could be my hair, my sweat or something else. I have tried cleaning them off and moving my hair away and I still continue to have this problem. It’s also difficult to hit the right spots on the ear piece all the controls. I end up pausing something when I’m trying to turn the volume up and down.
3. The audio quality tends to leave sometimes. - I can hear when my headphones need to be restarted. My phone calls will start to crackle and my volume won’t be as loud. It’s actually happened multiple times when I’ve been at full volume but the noise coming out of the headphones barely sounds like 3 notches.
4. Phone call quality not as advertised. - I purchased these because I use my headphones for calling because I use my hands a lot while working. I was under the impression my calls would sound clearer and sharper (for the other person) and the audio would focus on my voice a lot more than background noise. Background noise is picked HEAVILY and overpowers my voice while on the phone. I did not expect it to be perfect but for the price I still don’t want to step out of a room to take a phone call because of any background noise.
5. Charge Time - While I recognize the charge on these headphones doesn’t last as long as other brands, I still expect to not have to charge daily or every other day.
6. Noise cancellation - While it is actually very good, the ear pieces move once and no more noise cancellation.
I do have some pros as well, they aren’t all bad!
1. The controls are clear and very well set in the ear piece - I like not having to take out my phone constantly to use the controls and these headphones have all that.
2. They’re comfortable - I used to get headaches because of too small ear cushions. These ones fit over my ear very good and I don’t have headaches wearing headphones anymore.
3. They’re durable and transportable - I like the adjustable ear pieces and being able to turn them in and out. It’s easy for certain activities that are physical and I need to adjust. They don’t get in the way as often as headphones that don’t have this feature. I also tend to bump them less.
Overall, these have good qualities but I don’t believe they’re worth the price. I think you would be able to find over the ear, noise cancelling headphones with less glitches and issues for a cheaper price.",Verified Purchase,16 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2022"

Alan Carratalá,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a music expert, but I do consider an audiophile as I listen to music extensively throughout the day. I have never spent more than $120 on earphones/headphones, but I wanted to know what ""expensive"" headphones would sound like. I purchased these right before they were released, and just in time because I would've bought the WH-1000XM4 instead. Here's my take:
I like my music LOUD. At first, the max volume on the headphones was annoyingly low. I then realized that the issue was that the headphones internal volume was linked to the phone volume, but it was not at the highest setting. I had to (on an Android phone) separate both volumes, then unpair the headphones. After this, I paired them again and set the phone volume to max. From there, I increased the volume on the headphones using the touch controls until they were at max (the headphones will tell you.) This was a tremendous change and I am now satisfied with the volume.
The bass on these headphones are great, but I like deeper bass, to where it should sound muddled, so these did not meet my expectations. However, the bass is really good and doesn't muddle the rest of the music.
The noise cancellation is incredible. There is a HUGE change in what you hear with and without the noise cancellation. It doesn't completely blot out voices (or a television) but with pop music on 30%, you won't be able to hear external noise. The ""see through"" mode (hear through) amplifies the sounds around you so you can hear them while you listen to music, but if your music volume is above 40%, you still won't hear anything from the outside, unless it's very loud.
The headphones (with the app) come with a cool feature where they stop playback and enable the ""hear-through"" mode so that you can talk to people without having to either take off the headphones or stop your music. It works well, unless you're like me and you sing the songs you listen to. The music WILL stop if the headphones hear you singing.
Another cool feature is that if you remove the left earcup, music playback stops. This is because the headphones detect that you have taken them off. It's not a new feature among earphone tech (I have sub $100 earphones that do the same) but it's a neat trick that is useful to some of us. It appears that the sensor is only on the left earcup because removing only the right earcup does not stop music playback.
All in all, I am quite happy with me $400 headphones. The case is sturdy and cool-looking and definitely feels like expensive quality. Battery life is great and charging time is impressive (40 minutes according to my measures).",Verified Purchase,18 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022"
ArcherWrites,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a bunch of reviews and got these headphones because people were raving about them. I've had them for eight months or so now and wish i had gone with something else.
Pros: Good sound, comfortable when wearing.
Cons: Auto-shut off, difficult to maneuver for one-ear listening.
I've found that maybe I'm weird, but I often like to free an ear to listen to the room rather than the headphones. I began with the Sony app, which promised me all sorts of features, including ear sensing technology. In the end, I gave up on the app because any time I would remove one ear the entire system would stop playing. This sounds like a feature but it acts like a bug. If someone walks into the room and asks me a question, I generally pull off an ear so they can see that I'm listening. I know that noise-cancelling can be set so that I can hear people when wearing them, but again--I like to remove an ear. So, the system stops playing. I'd rather have a manual button that I can press. Maybe I'm old-school that way.
Also, and this may be nit-picking, but the bar feels too twisty; I'd prefer something more sturdy like on my trusty Sennheiser wired headphones. If I remove one ear on the Sonys, the entire apparatus slides down my head like warm molasses.
In the end, I guess my take is that the tech on these promises too many goodies and in the end just gets in the way of my usage. I'd love a Play/Stop button that isn't a weird tap (which, BTW, doesn't work very well). I'd love a thicker bar. I'd love to do away with ear-sensing tech. This is my second set of Sony headphones, though, so apparently I don't learn very quickly.

On the lowest setting the band is just too long, so the ear cups hang too low and then they don't feel tight enough and jiggle around.

Steven H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got a set of these headphones even though I already had a set of the last generation WH-1000XM4s. I just decided I wanted a second pair. So, I can say comparing directly to the XM4s there is very little improvement. The sound quality might be slightly better on the XM5s, a little wider sound stage maybe. But you have to listen really carefully to catch the difference. If I had my eyes closed and someone randomly put the XM4 or XM5 on my head, I would not be able to reliably determine which ones they were.
That said... the sound quality is really good. I'm not audiophile, but of the sub $500 headphone category, to me these are the best sounding headphones available.
Noise canceling is amazing. Between the simply noise isolation of the headphones then the active noise cancelling there is very little outside noise audible when I'm listening to music on these headphones. I've used them on an airplane and nearly all air plane noises are cancelled out.
The comfort however could still be improved. Like the XM4s IMO, extended listening starts to feel uncomfortable. The pressure is a little to much on the top of the head and around the ears. I have to adjust the head phones to sit at a slightly different angle every few minutes.

Tyler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've really enjoyed these headphones and find it difficult to take them off. I was stuck on either getting the XM4s or these and ended up with these as they were basically the same price with the Prime Deal.
The appearance of the XM5s ultimately made me decide to get these rather than the XM4s, but there is one important drawback I got from these: I can't wear these around my neck comfortably. They fold outward for no listed reason, so I'd have the ear cups rest on my collarbone. The way around this in which I found it the most comfortable would be wearing them above my ear, which is kind of obnoxious in my eyes, but it was the most comfortable position if I didn't want them on my ears.
They are super comfortable and I find myself about to fall asleep with them on. Doing activities such as school work with the active noise cancelling helped me get so much work done with little to no distractions. Using them at the gym hasn't really been a hassle, as I'd wear a hoodie to protect them from sweat. The music quality is superb and I haven't noticed any distortion from higher levels of music.
The things that would really drift me away, especially at this hefty price point would be:
The lack of any water resistance on the headphones
The ear cups not being able to rotate inwards or fold into themselves
Touch pad gestures should be able to be customized

James,2.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT 2/18/23: These headphones are so frustrating. They're great in so many ways and yet fail flat in certain places I expect a $400 pair of headphones to excel in since it's kind of very basic stuff I haven't had issues with from other much cheaper headsets. The multi point pairing is just crap if I'm being honest. When it works seamlessly jumping back and forth between my devices it's chef's kiss, but it inevitably fails. So many times I have both my phone and computer connected - I'm on my laptop, I stop the music then try playing something on youtube on my phone, but there's no audio. No problem, sometimes I can just double tap on the xm5 to open spotify and I'm connected to the phone so I can go back to youtube and the audio will play...but nope it'll play the spotify music but not youtube. But the audio on my computer still connected and works. So now I'm shutting the headphones down and turning them back on just so I can listen to something on my phone. Multipoint is supposed to be a convenient solution to switching between devices MANUALLY, but I've been having the exact opposite experience nearly everyday.
Also, I’m now experiencing random times the headphones will just turn off on its own WHILE IM USING THEM. No clue what causes this...but I don't think I can recommend these headphones anymore.
ORIGINAL REVIEW (**** out of *****):
I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.
I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.
PROS:
Great sound quality
Great noise cancelling
Great fit/comfort
Long battery life
Slimmer and less bulky than xm4
Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connection
Double click for spotify is awesome
CONS:
Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected to
Not compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for traveling
Headphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 case
The multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration. They would never switch to the other device properly and there were ridiculous delays - whether it's connecting or playing another device. It's one of the worst experiences I've had with multipoint BT.
The multipoint on these are better...but there are still times when it prioritizes the wrong devices and I have to turn off the bluetooth on my computer to listen to music on my phone...even though the music is clearly playing on the device. It also notifies you every time a device is connected or disconnected from the headphones - which is great but I wish I could turn this off since it constantly pings when I go out to the laundry room with my loads of clothes and disconnect or connect to my laptop.
I'm happy with these headphones but really wish there was a more elegant way to carry them around. I've actual gone without them due to the size of this thing which is a bummer since the sound quality is fantastic. I wish they kept the hinges from the xm4 so we can collapse them.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2023"

Does the very basic stuff headphones are supposed to well which is far too rare these days.
Audio quality is amazing for wireless headphones, the mic actually works well so far (only tested for calls).
Works perfectly without any tweaking, however I recommend taking some time to familiarize yourself with the Sony Headphones Connect app - it allows some seriously useful customization/optimization features, most of which are just checking a box and Sont does the rest. It's pretty amazing what they can do without user input in the way of adjusting the ANC based on location and activity and stuff, but still allowing user control over these settings.
I loved my WH-1000XM4s, not so much my WF-1000XM4s, these are simply a step above (at least) any other headphones I've used as far as daily use headphones go. Light on the head, don't get hot, don't make my head hurt, and finally someone at Sony figured out that it's not worth allowing the headphones to fold just to be a bit more compact.

Lance L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The overall build quality was great with the use of some high-quality plastic(or some other nice and light material) The new design didn't seem to impact functionality although it might help with the duration of the headphones by removing the hinges. However, to put the headphones back into the case, they had to be fully un-extended, which means every time I took it out I'd have to take some time to adjust the length again. Speaking of the case, the magnetic cable slot from the Bose headphones' case was nice and worked perfectly. The only complaint about the case is probably the zippers consistently get stuck near the two ends.
To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones. Personally, I thought it was slightly dull/dark with default settings and wasn't massive improvement from the previous gen. The EQ in the app did help tremendously and clearly reflected the changes I made and it was able to tune to my sweet spot. To be fair, I'm no expert in audio so take this solely as an opinion base review.
In terms of the ANC, Sony nailed it again and it blocked pretty much anything... Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars. The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).
Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints. First of all, the quick attention mode is a great feature but it would only work on the right side of the headphone as almost all other features on this headphone. All touch controls are on the right earcup while the left just has 2 buttons for ANC/AMB and power plus the wire jack. It'd be nice if there was the option in the app to choose which side the touch controls are on or just make it work on both sides. This is not possible and understandable if there's never a panel to do touch control on the left but that's probably good thing to add for the future. Also, I'm aware that I could literally just flip the headphone(as they seem to be identical except for the buttons) and wear the Right on my left year, but why?
Anyways, moving away from the left and right issues. Something minor would be that I'd personally like to customize my touch controls but that didn't seem to be an option in the app as I've looked in and out for it. Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.
Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly. I'm thinking it's more of an issue with the devices that I'm using(iPhone and iPad) which don't work exactly like devices in the Apple ecosystem. For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad. To make it change devices (I've tested it multiple times), I need to pause the audio on the current device in order automatically move to the other device. This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?).
Perhaps some of these issue could be fixed by updates perhaps not. I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless. I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy. Don't get me wrong, it's great and all, just not worthy as an upgrade.",Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2022"
Clayton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have without doubt been the best headphones I have ever owned in terms of noise canceling and call quality(speaking). The ANC is great because of the changes you can make within the app to it. Being able to manipulate the amount of hear through you have in ambient noise mode has been surprisingly helpful when trying to listen to music and complete other tasks. The full noise canceling is so impressive that at times I use it just for some quiet, no music or audio books playing, just great noise canceling silence. As far as the call quality goes, when on phone calls you can walk along a busy street or walk through a shopping center without the other person ever knowing. It is surprisingly adaptive to the surroundings and blocking the other noise out even while you are speaking. Absolutely would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs a great set of headphones and doesn't mind paying a little more. I purchased mine via the renewed store and they arrived almost mint condition. The only thing I could see was the plastic packaging that typically covers all of the equipment was already removed, otherwise brand new.
Only thing I would say against them is I would not recommend them for is working out.

Ray Woo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Bose's QC35 first edition for last 6 years. It has been serving me quite well through thick and thin. I paid about the same for Bose QC35. I believe they were $350 back then. Now I have been using XM5 for a week. I'm very satisfied!
COMFORT 5/5
These Sony's headphones are really comfortable for me. These headphones are as comfortable as my last Bose QC35. I have no problem wearing these for long hours. Really light and the special cushions do not create fatigue on ears or head. For reference, I'm an Asian male with a slightly bigger ears and head.
SOUND 5/5
I'm really impressed that these produce fuller sound out of box. And you can also change the EQ with the dedicated app. I've added a little boost in the mid and low in the EQ setting and I'm even more impressed. My last Bose headphones provide good neutral sound and can be easier on ears but Sony's headphones are much more enjoyable for most songs.
ANC 5/5
I live in California so most times at home I have a fan blowing at me not 2 feet away. My QC35 can eliminate good amount of wind noise and I couldn't really complain about it. But with XM5, I sometimes forget there is a fan blowing at me. My sister was listening to songs with ANC on, I was talking to her 2 feet away, she couldn't figure out what I was saying lol. But as soon as you cover the right ear cup, it switches to ambient sound right away.
BATTERY 4/5
The device advertises it has 30 hours. This may be true and should be enough for most even with the different features. I find battery is used a lot more with DSEE and ANC on but it should last a whole day or more. I'm just being a little picky about this.
FEATURE 5/5
I have them paired to my phone and my computer. There are zero delay between switching from one to another. As soon as I play something on one device when there is no sound playing in another, it switches to the active device. And there is no delay in switching to ambient sound when right ear cup is covered and switching back to whatever mode or ANC when it is uncovered.

I won't go detail about the sound quality like mid-tone, bass and other stuff because you can just watch review on YouTube. But I personally like sound on the Bose NC 700 more, just slightly more.

Darcy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually liked the headphones! Noise cancellation isn't as great as the AirPods Max and neither transparency, but the sound quality was a little better in my opinion. But the overall feel just felt like plastic??? I don't know how to exactly describe it but they were extremely light, which is a great thing for others but not for me, I want to the headphones to feel as if they're durable and high quality, these felt like they were about to break at some point. I wasn't a big fan of the texture and feel of the headphones so I decided to return them. Here's a massive problem though...
I decided to return them but BEWARE! Amazon customer service is absolutely terrible in helping you process the return. They keep telling me that the package is on it's way when I already checked with UPS and they're actually already delivered. Amazon customer service doesn't want to help me and they keep telling me that it takes two weeks for the package to be ""delivered."" They also told me that someone from Returns was going to reach out to me by my email within 24-48 hours and it's been over 48 hours since anyone has contacted me. It's stressing me out.
Also I had the chance to choose the option to pay the headphones in a monthly payment plan so I'm actually even more stressed and angry that they aren't taking the return process quickly and seriously, because what if I end paying the next month's payment and they still haven't processed the return?! What then?! I'm not paying for another monthly installment of headphones that I clearly returned and no longer own!! This is just a fair heads up that there are ups and downs when ordering anything highly priced with Amazon and when choosing to do monthly installments on highly priced items.
-Also be careful if you plan to order any other expensive headphones like Sony or Bose, the whole amazon returns and customer service are just sadly terrible when it comes to returning any electronic devices overall. I would rather buy new headphones off of best buy or target in person if you want to try them out and not hassle with a whole return process like amazon-

Trajon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep this as short as I can as I'm sure there have been a lot more thorough reviews over this product so I'll talk about some unique pieces that I got out of these headphones that I haven't seen from other reviewers.
For one thing, the really annoying thing about the xm4 for me personally was that those headphones were just too small; I previously owned the xm3 and have worn those down from the time that I put those on and bought those up recently to replace them, but I needed to send back those because after having on the headphones for more than a couple of hours I would get massive headaches overall because the headphones were just too small for me personally. Going to these headphones these were much more comfortable for a longer sessions, which to me alone is worth the extra spending on these headphones.
They're slightly better sound-wise than the xm4's but it's not anything most people would notice. The biggest thing with these is better controls for multiple connections to Bluetooth as well as convenience for quick charging if you forget to charge these overnight but want a long session for walking outside for example.
The adjustment to your environment is more noticeable outside than it really is if you are indoors. As you expect with sony's these are the top tier in terms of immersion in other environments, so much so to a point that I actually had these on at one point during an after-service dinner party just for the noise canceling to muffle out the sound of the music being played, as I had a headache at the time.

Conner Griffin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones and completely fell in love with them… only until I realized how incompatible they were if you weren’t a android user—so much so, I ended up returning them because of my frustration and fatigue with its interface.
If you use Apple products like I do, the headphones features like “360 audio” (which was a huge selling point for me) only works when you download an app for the headphones, and then again only works with certain apps and websites, not all audio like Apple Music or Spotify. I found this to be a huge let down and was even more annoyed I needed these myriad of apps to utilize a huge selling feature of the headphones.
Besides the compatibly issue the headphones were amazing: great design, amazing audio, and great battery life yet, ultimately for me it’s overly complicated ways and hoops to jump through as an Apple user is what steered me away here.
I instead bought the Apple AirPods Max, equally great sound quality, superior design, and elite performance, plus they are insanely and easily comparable with every thing Apple which was a huge selling point for me. Plus, their “spatial audio” (the same thing as “360 degree audio”) actually works seamlessly, which numerous apps, without jumping through hoops.

User,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you only care about noise cancelling, these headphones are hard to beat. If you only care about sound quality though, you may want to look elsewhere. My previous daily driver was a pair of Sennheiser HD58x Jubilees (paired with a Qudelix 5k cause rip the headphone jack) and they sounded amazing, arguably better than these headphones at a lower price, that's including the receiver. Switching to these almost felt like a downgrade until I turned on the noise cancelling. (NOTE: I do not recommend wearing these with noise cancelling off. You get better battery sure, but for some reason the cans amplify whatever ambient noise is around you and make them very echo-y/muddy and yes, I made sure it wasn't set to the pass through mode) It's almost like you are in a void and it doesn't negatively affect sound quality by a noticeable margin.
For whatever reason you can't use the usb cable to pass through audio so your two options are bluetooth and aux. The bluetooth is great. Can't say the same for aux. High frequencies sound like absolute trash through aux and the bass loses its thump. Plus you have to deal with the issues I mentioned before with noise cancelling being off.
Also, if you plan to work out with these, don't. The headset has a tendency to move and completely fall off if you move your head too much.
As for comfort, they're okay. The headband is too thin and starts do dig into your skull after a while.

Anonymous,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As both an audiophile and a professional DJ I have gone through, used, abused, and paid out a LOT of money for headphones thus far in my life and these are by far the best I have ever used. I have used Beats, Senheisers, Pioneers, Audio Technica, Shure,... You name it and I have probably had it in my gig bag or sitting next to my home system at some point or another.

Not only do they sound great, have great noise canceling, are crystal clear for phone calls, and give solid performance for those late night gaming sessions but they are so light and comfortable you hardly notice that you have them on. The minimalist design of both the headphones and the case make them easy to transport while taking up minimal space in the gig bag.

Chuck1998,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I’ve had these for about 72 hours and as my title said, I’m still on the fence to whether or not I’m returning these.
The PROS:
*The ANC (active noise cancelling) is unparalleled in my opinion. Standing near my sink with the water running, and music at a very low volume, I couldn’t hear the faucet running. Like, at all. Even without any music playing, the ANC is amazing.
*Great audio. I don’t know how it picked the song, but once connected to my phone it started playing the most chill and quiet slow beats of a song I’ve not listened to in a long time. I’ve never heard the song with such clarity. Flawless first audio impression.
The CONS:
*I gather that maybe they engineered these to be lightweight intentionally, as to not weigh down peoples heads for obvious reasons, but…I thought at least the circular part where the ear cup joins the bridge, would be metal, or metallic…but nope, plastic. It’s all plastic. And not just high density plastic, it’s that cheap low density plastic stuff. Like the cheap plastic you’d find in the cheapest toys section of a toy store. The entire thing feels…disposable. As if you get them for free when you board an airplane for a flight. After spending $400 on this, and opening the package, I INSTANTLY got a bad feeling it in the pit of my stomach, like I was ripped off by something on Alibaba, or Wish. These feel like disposable trash, folks. Which is the only thing making me contemplate whether or not to return these. I have a few weeks with Amazon prime to decide, so we’ll see. Like, usually with good tech you can feel the quality - either the specifications or the hardware. I can’t say that with these. They feel cheap. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
*This is a minor issue, but it irks me a bit. More of an FYI to you all. I have the black version. It’s matte black. Like that velvety smooth kind of matte black. Well, if you have oily skin, you might have a bad time. Unless you wash your hands obsessively before touching these…finger print magnets. Finger prints get everywhere. Instantly. I’d personally prefer smooth shiny plastic, as that coating will last longer (that matte coating WILL get scratched), and the shine of hard plastic wouldn’t show the finger prints everywhere. But anyways, that’s minor, and nowhere near as bad as the con of them feeling cheap.
That’s pretty much it! They do an excellent job audio wise, but despite knowing that, I still feel like it’s throwing money away. The audio trounces my Air Pod Pro’s (and their ANC) by a mile, and I’ve not tried the Air Pod Max’s. But because they feel SO cheap, I feel like I’m getting ripped off. The case is nice tho, so they do lay flat - as you can see in people’s pics.
I’ve not charged them yet, and I’ve used them loads…so I’m assuming their 30 hours battery life is legit.
If you have Amazon Prime, go ahead and order them. You’ll have to gauge for yourself how you feel about the lightweight plastic’y feeling. If you don’t have prime, I’d hold off, try to find them in a mall or something to try out.
It’s disappointing when you’ve been waiting for a model to come out for so long, and then you’re left…unfulfilled. I’m gonna keep the, for a spin for a few weeks, and we’ll see.

LyricSpring77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This probably is my first product that I pre-ordered. I generally wait, do extensive research and try it myself before spending such a huge amount on any product. Sony has built a very strong brand for itself in the wireless headphone space since the launch of XM series. XM 3-4 both are great products, with no major issues. But they both had 1 or 2 drawbacks that didn't push be enough to upgrade and buy one.
XM4 Bass is little forward for me. I like to prefer tighter, clear bass. XM5 delivers that.
XM5 - the good Stuff
1) ANC - Best ANC in the market. I own several Bose headphones and earbuds. This has far the best ANC.
12 Quick setup- It took me not more than 5 mins to open the box, connect my phone and start listening. Battery was pre-charged to about 65%
3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality. Will have to see how it performs during sweaty, hot environment.
4) Connectivity- It connect seamless, and quickly. The range is insane. I can literally walk all around in my home or in my backyard away from my phone and it stay connected. I have had no issue of any drop at all.
5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly
6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.
7) Multiple device connectivity
8) Love the Sand (white) color
9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing. The default EQ out of the box is really good. But if you customize the EQ and bump little bit the Clear bass and treble it just sounds amazing.
It's been 6 hours non-stop listening for me, I have played all kind of genre and they all sound great.
XM5-Not so good
1) Carrying Case - Case is little big, flatter. The headphone doesn't fold. Not a huge deal, but it could be issue for some.
2) It can get hot after couple of hours.
To sum it up, for 4hunderd bucks, it is not a cheap headphone. But does it deserve the price tag and delivers on that. YES! With all the features it has, I really do not find anything that I am going to be missing or need for at least several years. It even has a 3.5mm jack :)

Aja,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were faulty when I got them. They wouldn’t stay connected to any device and randomly disconnected. I returned it and ordered a new pair but it took me a lil over two weeks to get a refund. I had to hunt drop it off at a specific Amazon locker and then contact customer sales after two weeks of not receiving updates. Luckily, they refunded me right away once they confirmed they got it.
So here’s my revised review of the product. The Bluetooth connection does need to be set EACH time I use it with any apple products. Mildly annoying bc I’d love for it to connect automatically but I have it paired with three nearby devices so this is acceptable to me. The new pair sometimes disconnects randomly but not much and a quick button click gets it back on. With zoom it’s even more weird but I think that’s more to do with zooms interface than these headphones so I’m not faulting them here.

Aaron W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Too much too say. I did a lot of research on these and Bose QC 45/35 II/700 and these seem to take the cake over Bose by a lot. My friend had the QC 35 II and the sound was kinda lifeless tbh. The QC 45 just have less features (even though they just added an EQ) than the 35s and I heard the build quality was WORSE on than the 35s. Very disappointed by Bose because when I wore the 35 they were very comfortable. The sound quality on these are amazing and you can adjust what you want with the EQ. The only thing Bose BARELY is better at is comfort but by barely. This beats it in every single other aspect and has a lot more features on it. It's way worth these over the other headphones even if it's a little more expensive. You get what you pay for. Build quality is great on these too. Don't feel cheap at all in my opinion or feel like their going to break. It seemed like a good business decision too me too not let these fold because I heard people's xm3s/4s broke often from the folding mechanic after often usage. The case isn't even that big IMO. These are amazing would suggest these over any other Bluetooth headphones. If you're getting anything better than this you're dipping into the $800-$1000++ range and even further and those aren't even wireless those are ranged Hi-Fi headphones. These are just fine as mentioned before the sound quality is just great to me(I'm not an audiophile).

Caleb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For years, I've favored earphones over headphones. The storage, weight, and wind resistance all led me to choose excellent earphones from Google, Klipsch, and the Sony WF-1000XM4. Now, unless I have limited storage capacity or if it's raining, I choose the WH-1000XM5 for most commuting, travel, and inside of my home situations.
Imagine walking on a sidewalk during rush hour in a busy metropolitan area but only somewhat being able to hear the most annoying of drivers, honks, and overly loud engines (if playing music). It's not perfect, but it is the best noise cancelling I've yet experienced. Even without playing anything, it muffles the noise enough that I feel somewhat disconnected from the crazy traffic. When crossing a street, one can either push a button for ambient sound or simply cup a hand over the right ear to temporarily activate ambient sound.
The swipe controls (volume increase / decrease and forward / back for tracks) make this pair of headphones easier to operate than any other pair of headphones I have. No need to look away to handle my music or podcasts, which is quite helpful.
While on the train, passengers' sounds fade away, allowing me to focus on whatever I'm listening to or watching. You will feel the base in these headphones, sometimes in an oddly powerful way (as if it is putting too much power into a track accidentally) but mostly the way bass should feel.
Personally, I prefer the more plastic feel these headphones have because of their flexibility. Could I break them? Yes, but not accidentally. It would take deliberate effort on my part to break them. That said, I've always preferred flexible headphones such as the SteelSeries Arctis 9X Wireless Gaming Headset. Others may prefer the more solid (inflexible) feeling metal ones like the WH-1000XM4.

These are the first expensive headphones I have ever purchased, and I must say, never have I experienced music like this before. These headphones have made me listen to music in a whole different way. Only when it is paired with it's noise cancelling feature do you stop and listen to things that weren't there before. They sit comfortably in my head without squeezing it to death or giving me a headache. The noise cancelling feature can take a little to get used to (couldn't last more than 5 minutes without any music and NC on) but it is well worth it. They also come packed with a boatload of smart features that I am personally not using but may come in handy for other folks. All in all, if you're looking for some quality headphone that will get you through that midnight flight, look no further.
The only negative note that I could find is that initial setup may be a little bit tedious to get it just the way you want it (Account, Assitant, Noise Cancelling, Ambient Sound, linking music provider, Adaptive control?, and a bunch of other stuff).

TCG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned the original 1000X (M1) and the M3. Both of those headphones have excellent comfort with large ear cups and rigid headbands with padding. ANC on both of those headphones is very powerful and able to block out low frequency engine and fan noise very well. They have 4 cm drivers that deliver very punchy audio, with the complaint of bloated bass that can be mostly controlled by EQ.
I had high hopes for the XM5 model, but overall it is a downgrade in all categories except for microphone quality.
COMFORT - The comfort on the XM5 for me is terrible. The headband is limp, thin, and poorly padded. As a result clamp force is weak and nearly all the headphone weight is focused onto 1-2 cm on the top of your hear. This became intolerable for me after 30 minutes. The ear cups are more shallow and my ears become compressed leading to ear pain after 1 hour. The padding is non breathing, leading to very hot ears after a short time. The headphones did not sit firmly on my head and kept sliding around. Making them tighter, though, only exacerbated the pain on the top of the head.
AUDIO QUALITY - The drivers have been reduced to 3 cm, and this is noticeable both in reduced maximum sound pressure level, but also much reduced impact. Dynamics are maintained and bass and treble clarity are much improved. If you are not concerned about impact of music, this could be considered an improvement. However, overall, the headphones sound quite sedate, lack incisiveness, and generally lack the excitement of the prior XM series.
ANC - The ANC quality is much reduced compared with the prior models in the XM series. If you stand right next to an AC unit or fan you can hear the ANC turn on after about 5 seconds and powerfully reduce the noise. However if you walk a few feet away, the ANC goes back into low mode and the noise returns. Even worse, if you are across the room the ANC appears to turn off nearly entirely, letting in most of the noise. This is not user error where I have the ambient sound let through. The ambient mode was turned to off and I could observe reduction in external noise in ANC on vs off modes. However it is much reduced compared with MX1 or MX3, perhaps only 30% the strength of those.
PORTABILITY - The MX5 do not fold, and equally frustrating you have to fully compress the telescoping band into itself before you can place in the case. The left arm of the headband had 5x more resistance than the left leading one side to auto-elongate while on my head, which also was a poor experience.
Imagine if the XM5 were the prior model and the XM4 is the current one. They could advertise the following changes: ""Since the last version we updated with larger, punchier 4 cm drivers, added extra padding to the headband and made the cups larger with more room for your ears, and boosted ANC to function at full power to ensure no leakage of noise"".",Verified Purchase,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2022"
Jake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To preface, I did not own the previous iteration of these headphones, the XM4. I did however have the XM3. So most of this review will be a comparisom from the 3 to the 5. That being said, here are my thoughts.
Noise Canceling:
As always, sony headphones are excellent at Canceling out noise. These headphones have 2 of the noise Canceling chips in them and double the microphones as the XM4. When listening to music the outside world is almost completely silent. Especially lower tones like the running of an engine, whether that be plane or car. Higher, fast tones slip through occasionally but not to any degree that's distracting. I find for the higher tones these headphones are much better than the XM3. Overall the noise Canceling is wonderful and definitely won't disappoint.
Sound Quality:
I am by no means a professional when it comes to audio. In my own experience I find that these headphones have great sound quality. Better than the XM3 infact. It feels more clear and crisp and the bass has a bit more oomph to it in my opinion. Overall it's great sound and definitely an improvement from the XM3. As said before, I can't compare to the XM4 since I've never had them.
Build Quality:
This is where the headphones fall a little short. The design, although incredibly comfortable, is rather plastic feeling. It's not cheap feeling plastic, but it's definitely a plastic feeling. They are quite comfortable and I wore them for several hours at a time and never got any pain from them. In addition to the plastic feeling, these headphones also don't fold in on themselves like the previous iterations did. The cups flip over so the headphones can be laid flat but that's it. Subsequently, the included carry case is slightly larger than before. I personally haven't had any qualms with its size but I think it's something to keep in mind.
Overall I think these are a fantastic pair of headphones and definitely worth the price if you're coming from the XM3 or earlier. Sound quality, noise Canceling capability, and comfort of the XM5s is just fantastic and its really a premium experience. Although it's kinda plastic feeling I still feel it deserves five stars especially since the only time I notice the plastic is when they're in my hands and not on my head.",Verified Purchase,22 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2022"

However the key issue (and cause for 2 stars off) is that for all these headphones can do (and despite some tricky connection gymnastics with the app / Bluetooth, though I chalk most of that up to the technology not Sony) you cannot mute/unmute your microphone in any way with this headset (at least not out of the box or through any settings or searching I've done) even though the headset has mappable functions, and even unmapped button patterns that i can only use for one service and cannot assign to any useful functions.

The issue is that I recently was very disappointed with high advertised medium priced headphones, so after a bunch of research I went to these, as multiple sources indicated xm4 or xm5 as best recommendation.
It is understated luxury. Box not flashy, headphones smooth without any huge brand names, fit perfectly, came in galf charged. After turning them on, I did not even need to invoke pairing dialog on my laptop, it automatically jumped out offering to pair. After paired to my phone and installing app, it automatically caught that I use Google Assistant and not Alexa and suggest to be linked to. Taps and swipes for managing volume, pause, tracks are so intuitive, I needed only to glance through the instructions and see ""hold and swipe"", and it made sense.
So far first impression is great - you pay not for flashiness, but for comfort, quality and ease of use.

James Irmiger,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are, without a doubt, the absolute pinnacle of noise cancelling headsets...not headphones. Let me explain
I have never heard such amazing noise cancelling. The feature set for touch controls and app integration is, unquestionably, peerless. As a headset you wear to dampen noisy commutes, quiet a loud office, or dull the roar of an airplane, all while casually listening to music in a non-critical way, these are a must-have. However! If you enjoy the quality of your music first and foremost, while casually trying to dampen a noisy commute, quiet an office, or dull an airplane, secondly, these are not for you. Headphones are supposed to cover your ears and play music. Music!! Maybe movies..and YouTube..and Game of Thrones..you get the point.
The sound quality in these is best described as, adequate...though mostly bordering on dismal. Certainly not what you're looking for in top tier Sony headphones. It's generally, ok, but muddy as heck. The bass is fine down low, but the upper bass is pervasive in a way that's very unwelcome, despite eq tuning AND customized eq settings from the AutoEQ project AND a third party app. Almost the exact sound profile as Sony's XB (extra bass) series of headphones. The treble rolls off too soon, leaving you with a sound best described as ""under a wet blanket"". The electronics do correct it, but turn them off and use the included headphone cord in a passive, wired connection, and you'll hear what I'm talking about.
I'm in no way dinging them for anything they do, or don't do. It's all about what Sony is trying to offer the consumer. Almost all of these features can be had in the 900 and 700 series, for much less money, and roughly the same sound quality. Heck, even the older XM4's sound roughly the same for WAAAY less money. No, what I'm pointing out is that for a 1000 series, the best of the best, the highest you can go, the most expensive ANC headphones Sony makes, they should -at least- have drivers in them that sound decent. Then, and only then, go ahead and add in some onboard trickery to clean them up a little bit. It's a bait and switch. Cruddy hardware with a ton of post-processing and a killer app to drive home the price.
I love what they represent, but Sony, really?!! You can do better.
Ps. If you really like bass, but clean bass, get the Sennheiser Momentum 4's and if you like a more audiophile-style profile based on mids and highs, try the Bowers and Wilkins PX7 S2's.

But over the last few charge cycles, mine would get maybe 7 hours even without heavy bass and ANC. I’m sure it’s just a problem specifically with mine as I’ve seen real reviews saying the battery life is solid. Maybe I’ll get another pair down the line as I returned it
One thing I can say I hated was how it behaved with glasses. I need mine to see what I’m working on, and just moving my head around would make a creaking sound very similar to how old floorboards sound. Short of turning up the volume way too high, it didn’t go away. Definitely isolated to glasses as taking them off would remove the creaking entirely. But being blind isn’t a viable solution for me.
Summary:
Battery wasn’t good on mine, I’m sure that’s just a defect where the large majority will have a great battery life but I can’t vouch for that yet
If you don’t wear glasses, they’re fantastic. The sound was punchy and accurate. They’re comfortable to wear too
If you do wear glasses, just keep that in mind. It was enough to make me very frustrated.

Comfort is a little better than the XM4. Wearing glasses I still have discomfort within an hour. Without glasses they don't overheat my ears for longer periods of time. The headband is slightly less comfortable than the XM4.
Sound quality is an improvement that was noticeable. I did dropped down the 16khz to hear vocals better. The 360 on Tidal was barely noticeable in the difference. I would not pay for this feature alone when picking a streaming provider (my opinion). I use my wired open back Sennheiser HDs when at the computer, dac, etc..
Portable the XM4 shines. The way these collapse around your neck could have been designed to at least flip the ears down vs up. Case is nice, but similar to the bulky Bose. The do feel more durable than the XM4s, but not by much.

If I were buying headphones in the $350 to $400 range I would buy the Technics EAH-800 for better value. Yes Sony does a lot of advertising but the Technics are made by Panasonic and they have a great history in reproducing quality sound.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022"
Aaron Gleason,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an owner of a pair of Sony 900-series headphones, I knew basically what to expect. A comfortable set of headphones with outstanding noise cancellation and great battery life. These headphones take that to the next level.
Not only is the noise cancellation improved, it's location sensitive. I find this feature a little gimmicky but it will dynamically figure out what kind of noise cancellation profile to use based on its app and manual overrides from you. Most of the time you don't have to do anything.
Battery life is outstanding too. On a 9-hour overseas flight, I use 10% of my battery using the headphones continuously with the noise cancellation enabled. That's impressive. Charging is quick too, but you really have to go out of your way to drain the battery to a level where you need to charge it.
Comfort is excellent as usual. Super soft ear and head pads make for a lightweight wearing experience. I had no ear fatigue after the long flight. With the 1/8"" plug, it works well with my gaming laptop with no lag and still having noise cancelling available. I can't even hear the noisy (~60dB) fans on my computer with these headphones on.
Noise cancellation is improved, but I did find it had some issues with (1) eating (where the jaw bone is moving the ear cups) and (2) moving your head side to side (getting some false noise readings where the surface is sound absorbent, like an airplane seat). I'm certain this will be improved upon in the future, as Sony releases software updates frequently for the headphones.
Overall, this is a huge upgrade from my 900-series Sony headphones. They're lighter, more comfortable, and have better noise cancellation. Recommended.",Verified Purchase,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2022"

Joseph R. Granto,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My old WH-1000XM3 was start to not hold a charge, so I got the WH-1000XM5. I also own a WH-1000XM4. The WH-1000XM5 fits well enough and is comparably comfortable. Functionally, it is on par with the M3 and M4.
Sound-wise, it sounds about the same - no complaints.
The noise cancellation, however, is not as good as the M3 or M4. Both the M3 and M4 seem to have static cancellation, by which I mean you can use the app to tell it to sample your environment and it determines the best cancellation. It then stays on this setting until you sample your environment again. This was very effective and I had no complaints.
The M5 seems to dynamically determine environment and cancellation by constantly sampling sounds in the environment. You can be seated on a plane, turn your head, and suddenly the noise cancellation sucks because the headset is sampling the environment because it detecting a noise change when you moved your head.
Worse still, I was on a noisy jet seated next to the window. The drone from the engines was super load. The headset did a decent job at cancelling the drone, but would often freak out as it sampled the environment, leading to an odd and unpleasant effect where the engine noise would warble up and down in volume. It was terrible and I almost returned the headset because it was so unpleasant.
Other plane trips that did not have unusually loud engine noise were pleasant, and the headset performed well except for when I turn my head too far. I decided to keep them, but I would not call myself pleased with them. The M3 and M4 were better, IMO.
I use this kind of headset almost exclusively for travel, and have had no issues with any WH-1000XM# headset with respect to fit, finish, or durability. They have all been great.
My recommendation would be to get the WH-1000XM4 instead.",Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022"

I skipped XM4 as I heard it's not much better than XM3.
As for XM5, as I heard it's got phenomenal features, so I wanted to give it a try.
For sound quality, it is definitely alot better than XM3-
Its directional sound is noticeably better than that of XM3,
And music/movies/games just sound so much better.
Some of the really cool feature it's got are speak to chat and multiple connection features.
Speak to chat allows me to talk to someone freely without taking off the headphones.
Multiple connection feature allows me to switch from my PC to my phone instantly when I get a call, or play a video on my phone.
As for noise cancelling, XM3 seems to have better ANC.
I thought I was able to hear more noises when wearing XM5, but it didn't seem that far off.
My biggest disappointment was its comfort.
Due to playing video games on a daily basis for long time, I sometimes wear the headphones for 8~12 hours. XM5 doesn't feel as comfortable as XM3 when wearing for long hours.
After about 2-3 hours of wearing XM5, it feels quite uncomfortable and it hurts my ears, which is weird, because XM5 is described to have larger earcups than that of XM3.
Due to its comfort, I'm quite unsure if this headphone is worth paying $400 for to upgrade from XM3.",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2022"

The only reason I returned them is even on their smallest adjustable setting they were too big for my normal sized head. They hung just a little too low on my ears.

The only reason these headphones, and any other headphones with a microphone will never get 5 stars from me is the lack of a mute button. Sony, please make that one of the ""Quick Action"" customizations. In this day and age with remote working more popular than ever and endless remote meetings you don't have mic mute functionality? For my meetings I have to switch to another pair of headphones that do have a mute button but no ANC or long wearing comfort so that is the only bummer.
For me, they are incredibly comfortable and the dual connection with my phone is the smoothest and most trouble free I have ever experienced. Also, the touch controls are much more responsive than the XM4s that these replaced.

Bunny,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit after 5 months of use:
Disconnects are more frequent, and at times it would suddenly lower the audio quality. The only way to fix it is to stop everything you're doing, turn it off, turn it on, and hope it reconnects. If I could, I'd get a refund. Either I have a defective model or it happens to everyone just not as frequent.
**Edit after a month of use:
Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery. Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it. With no way to adjust the amount of Noise Cancellation happening, the M3's I've been using has better blocking on some occasions. The issue with the band on the top is still just as bad, it genuinely hurts after long amounts of use. The only improvement from the M3 that I see is I can KIND OF sleep on my side with these on and they stay on my head better without sliding down.
I still do no recommend this unless you plan on wearing it for short periods and in a quiet environment.**
So this review is coming from someone who's worn the M3 Headset for over 4 years and I have to say, it's awful.
I live in a place where there's sound in every direction. Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.
So the good:
- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.
- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good. You need to download the Sony app to alter the sound to allow any bass to work, otherwise it'll sound static-y.
- ANC is awesome but it's adaptive, which I don't like, but can be a plus for some. When it worked it blocked out almost every single sound.
- The case design is cool, it has a little compartment inside that holds the charger cable and headphone jack.
The bad:
- I'm used to my M3's cancelling noise constantly, this device would adapt to the sound around you, letting sound bleed through before blocking it out after. Example: I was listening to a song at moderate volume, I could make any sound I want and I couldn't hear it. When the music had a break in volume, I could hear a LOT outside the headphones.
- The head band that goes over your head is PAINFUL! It legit hurt after only an hour of use, it has almost NO padding and it was a thin plastic.
- THE COLLAPSABLE CASE IS TERRIBLE! I unzipped the case to take the headphones out, I used them for a good 2 hours, put them back into the case, and when I went to open it again the zipper got stuck and it's IMPOSSIBLE to open now. Trust me, I got three separate people to try and open the case, they can't.
I've been looking forward to a new ANC headphone brand, and I'm disappointed Sony didn't have someone wear these for more than an hour or try zipping and unzipping the bag more than a few times before going ""yep, let's send them out."".
Sadly, I do no recommend these unless they are on sale and you DIY a comfortable way of wearing them for the top of your head. If they update the ANC and you want to work on making it not hurt the top of your head, they are decent, but not 400$ plus tax decent.

penguin22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from the XM3 headphones, I find the XM5 better in every way where it matters. For me, they are far more comfortable, with larger earcups that no longer touch my ears and somehow reduced pressure on my head overall. The headband is improved for me, though this is one area that may differ for people, so ymmv. ANC is far better than in the XM3 and the adaptive nature means that I don't have to do anything to get the benefit in different environments. With the XM3, I never made changes to the ANC settings, so this is a big improvement. Sound is superb, acoustically nuanced with great sound separation, spaciousness, and tight response. You may want to adjust the EQ to your specific preferences, though it is balanced and brighter than the XM3 enough that is makes the former headset sound muddy after listening to the XM5 headset. I know most reviewers have complained about the case and I'm bewildered by that response. It's not that much larger than the prior case in height and width, is a bit thinner with a taper from the cup at the bottom to the band at the top and stays more securely in place in my laptop bag as a result. Perhaps this is an issue for smaller bags if there isn't and extra room, though in my case, this was an improvement for my travel needs along with no longer having to bother folding and unfolding the headphones every time I use them.

Even that tiny space that is created by my glasses is enough to drastically reduce the ANC which isn't so amazing to begin with. The head grip is shoddy. C'mon-do better, Sony. I was so excited. Guess I'm going to see how the latest Bose cans compare. It's a sad day.
I’m a headphone fanatic, noise-cancelling addict. I’ve been rocking AirPod Pro’s and decided to jump into the new XM-5’s -largely because of Flossy Carter’s rare “quad major go”, but after three days with them, I have to said that the noise cancelling isn’t nearly as good as the Air Pods. I have The noise cancelling on max setting, good ear cup seal, and I hear running water and people talking quietly next to me. With my Air Pods, I can hear nothing but music. Okay, the good, the sound quality is decent. You know, not booming bass, but balanced-ESPECIALLY when used with EQE or even Sony’s watered down EQ app. The battery life has been very good-I get about 30 hours and the touch controls are solid. Also. Yesterday, I was on Main Street with racing, noisy after market exhaust, blasting stereos and I made a call. The caller had no idea. She thought I was sitting in a quiet office. That’s a very amazing thing. I mean, I do like these headphones very much. The build is light, but sturdy, they charge HELLA fast. I had 60 percent and plugged in for15 minutes and got up to 90%. Is it worth $421? No, I think the Xm-3’s would have worked just as well. Am I returning these? No, don’t want to hassle and I do like them, but if you’re looking to buy, I’d wait for a sale or go with a lower model and if you are okay with 6 hour battery life, go with AirPod Pros or for $400, get two pairs of AirPod pros.

BryanFarme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've previously owned all generations of Sony's flagship WH-1000 headphones and have always been impressed with the sound and the noise canceling feature which is primarily what they are renowned for. I was disappointed with the fit of the previous model as they did not fully cover my ears and became uncomfortable after an hour of wearing. The 5th Gen are lighter and seem to fit better. I've worn them constantly since buying them and they feel good.
To really get the full benefit of these headphones you need to be prepared to install Sony's Headphone app which opens up more settings. The noise cancelation is exceptional. I can barely hear anything around me when it's turned on full. I also don't get any vacuum sensation or high pitched frequency noise when NC is on which is a huge plus. The audio quality is really well balanced for my ears and taste in music. The bass is there, but not too dominant, mids are clear and the highs are crisp without being tinny. I love that the sensors pause audio when I remove the headphones and resumes when I wear them again. They also effortlessly switch between my Samsung phone and Samsung tablet without any hassle.
The only minor gripe I have is with the new design carrying case. It's not as small or robust as previous generations and feels quite flimsy. I guess I'll see how well it holds up over the coming weeks. As before a USB type C charging cable is included along with 3.5mm jack for wired audio.

David Scroggins,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really did want to love these, and there's a lot to love. The sound quality on them is very good for bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and the Sony app offers a good amount of customization of the learning experience. The associated music app is far better than the competitors and the ability to adjust and learn your preferred settings by location is very cool (and in my limited time using them, useful). But there are a couple of major flaws that resulted in me returning them: 1) the Bluetooth connectivity with both my Pixel and my Macbook Pro was very unstable and unpredictable. Just listening to music was spotty at times and far too frequent for a pair of premium headphones. Further their integration with Microsoft Teams on Macbook was completely unpredictable (sometimes the sound was fine, sometimes I'd have sound with no mic, sometimes nothing at all, and sometimes nothing for the first 10 seconds of a meeting then they'd suddenly start working). I tried every approach or hack I could come up with to resolve these issues. For me most of the utility of ANC headphones is being able to seamlessly switch between whatever it is I'm doing. Bluetooth is heavily dependent on implementation, I get it, but Bose has figured out how to stably connect to both Macbooks and Pixels so some of the blame for this is on Sony. 2) they're honestly not comfortable headphones. I might have returned them just for this. The headband padding is very thin and the crown of my head would begin to ache if I wore these for more than 30 minutes at a time. Comfort is subjective though, so your mileage may vary.

Alex P. Novickis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"In re to WM1000XM5
First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.
Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.
Noise reduction - works very well. At times, I have a rack of noisy dell servers in my work area - and with the headphones on I can't hear them at all.
My usage model may not be what is expected from Sony, so let's go over that first.
Primarily, I use these on a windows PC, a Mac, an iPad or iPhone - for music, AV conferencing, video such as YouTube - and gaming.
And so, from a usability perspective, there are some further considerations
First off, out of the box the headphones have particular settings for power on timeout, audio configuration and ANR feature, that are required to be accessed by the user - and these settings while extremely important - *they are NOT available from the headphones or a PC*, *instead, they are only available from android or iOS devices*.
- Out-of-the-Box, the firmware requires an update as some important bugs have been fixed. The update process while working takes *close to an hour* to download the latest firmware due to the speed of Bluetooth. Once the update was complete, the features that are present in the out-of-box version that are not desirable still exist in the updated 1.1.1 version;
- No customer documentation shows what features were fixed or enhanced.
- Discovering what version your headphones currently have is also not obvious. It's hidden in the iOS app so you have to spend a few minutes going through all the menus.
- The iOS app is also trying to sign you up, mine user information, and sell you things, so it's fairly annoying to have that built into the app that is meant for basic headphone settings.
- Headphones will occasionally stop receiving audio from the player device for no obvious reason. This falls into several different types of errors. 1) Random turn off (not power or user interaction related, and not related to ""keep on while wearing"" setting, _OR_ (2) no sound is output for headphones even though PC shows connected, the player is playing. _OR_ (3) PC shows no Bluetooth device on occasion. _OR_ (4) video/audio player on the PC will go to a ""paused"" state. - Keep in mind, no interaction by the user was made with the headphones.
- In the case the headphones randomly power off, then just turning them back on, and pressing the left button a couple times will restore. It takes about 10-20 seconds to get back to working for the stack to re-establish the connection..
- In the case of random pauses of your YouTube player. Using a tap on the right side will restore play, Sometimes many hours will go by without this problem, but at other times this will happen multiple times in a just a few minutes. But it gets better! Sometimes using a tap to start playing again, will start a similar player on the iOS device - even though you never switched from using the PC by any user action.
- Using the headphones in a game environment seems to increase the occurrence of these sorts of issues. Having a YouTube player open, but in a pause state while having a game open and audio from the game playing to headphones will complicate matters. Occasionally the sound will stop working here, and tapping the right ear piece in the game will start the YouTube player, but not connect you to the game sound, and sometimes the game sound starts working, and other times you get a mix of both.
- Sound delay from sound being played on PC to the time it's actually heard on the headphones is quite noticeable at times and not a fixed but slowly varying quantity. I would estimate as much as 200ms at times.
- On occasion the headphones will switch some internal operating mode and then raise or lower the volume of the playback by as much as 40% or so. Completely with no user interaction. This problem does not seem to happen often and seems somehow related to the ANR mode.",Verified Purchase,27 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2022"
L.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Objectively speaking this headset might be superior to XM4 and, as all the tech reviews say, the best overall deal, but my experience was unsatisfactory. I have an average size adult ear and band size for females -- I always buy a size medium hat, etc, but found these did not fit well at all. The earcups on the XM5s are a bit stiffer than the XM4s and do not provide the seal the old version had for me, especially over thin glasses frames, even when they were brand new. The XM5s are also hotter and less comfortable to wear over long periods of time.
My other problem with them is that the noise cancelling is a bit too smart with the automation. This may make them excellent for transit noise, however they performed poorly in a situation where there was some division between myself and noise I want to escape, such as cubicle walls etc; the ANC wasn't as responsive in these environments and provided less ANC than the XM4s. The ANC also would audibly change as I moved about - even when when I had that auto-switchy feature turned off - giving me a weird sensation of motion sickness when something actually activated the mics, like an overhead fan. I would appreciate being able to have a greater degree of manual control over that and a more seamless ANC.
The touch controls are also extremely sensitive, so if you tip your head or reach for something, you'll be pushing buttons with the tiniest brush of your fully clothed shoulder. I had to turn this feature off, making it useless to me.
Due to the poor seal reducing the effectiveness of the ANC to begin with, the smarter-than-I-want-or-need auto ANC, and reduced comfort of fit, I have returned the XM5s.",Verified Purchase,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023"

Fernando,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, so. This are my first headphones with ANC, pretty much the reason I bought them. To be honest I'm a little bit disappointed with ANC in particular. I've read the comments and I thought that it was going to be something near complete silence. Let me tell you, it's not even close. Yeah, it reduces a lot, but you can still hear voices, horns, and a lot of noises. Maybe I'm pretending to much and this is really the best you can get. But I don't know. A friend of mine told me that with beats bud pro the ANC is much better, but I've never tried it.
Another problem that I found out is common, is that you can have interference with AM radio when ANC is on. It happened to me, and with the bad luck that happens right where I sit to use them.

Vrajesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Design: I love the silver color, looks so glittery and subtle when you look closely. The design looks so much better than the previous models.
Sound: Trust me when I say this, they sound way better than Sony Xm4’s. The bass is so much better than what was considered best, before. It feels to me that Mark 4’s lost so much of details in the sound quality, when you listen to this.
ANC: Noise cancellation has been improved by a lot.
They still cannot cancel noise to a 100%, but well, no headphones can do it yet, but it is the best of any headphone out there. (Airpods max is so close to this), close but not upto this.
Transparency/Ambient mode: They sound so much better in this mode than Mark 4’s due to new improved number of mics. Still cant hear 100% of the outside world (like you still cant hear a song playing in an uber as loud as it sounds without an headphone, but still make out what you’re listening to). But I can wear these all day and listen to the world outside, it feels like its removing some useless noises of the real world and that sounds good.
Cons: They sound a little better in Androids and pc/laptop with LDAC than on any iphone. But that difference is almost negligible and I still decided to keep them for the iphone because I love the sound.
Overall: They’re worth $400, and they’re still cheaper than Airpods max. Lmao.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022"

While I was completely impressed with the superior noise cancelling, the terrible battery life and impossible audio controls (when connected to two devices), made me ship them back. Then I broke my XB900Ns and needed to find a suitable replacement. Since the NC700s were out, I tried a set of Sennheiser PXC550-ii headphones... for a couple of hours. Those got sent back because they are not for fat melon-headed people such as myself. The Sennheiser noise cancelling and audio quality were fabulous. I just couldn't live with the fit. So, I ordered a set of these cans to replace my old XB900Ns. 4 hours in, the noise cancelling is on par with the NC700s. The multi-device connectivity fairly flawless.

Moching,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancellation feature works extremely well which is important to me when I'm flying.

For music, they seem quite a bit louder than the buds I was using prior, using the volume control on my device, I'm mid way up in volume and they're plenty loud, whereas with buds, I had to have the volume all the way up. Sound quality is good, balanced with decent bass and the equalizer on the app let's you fine tune a bit.

Realistic Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the WH-1000XM3 & they were the best ANC headphones I'd ever encountered, until the WH-1000XM4 came out & yes I did upgrade. The WH-1000XM4 was a big improvement over the already extremely hot WH-1000XM3. Needless to say I wondered if Sony would make a WH-1000XM5, because how do you improve on perfection??? Well I pre-ordered these from Amazon & I got the this afternoon. Sony not only improved perfection, they redefined it!
The WH-1000XM5 are incredible! The previous WH-1000XM4 had 1 Sony QN1 ANC processor with 4 microphones & it did an amazing job at noise cancellation! It even had a handy button on the headphones themselves that once pressed would start an automated ANC optimization algorithm. Well, these new WH-1000XM5 not only have an updated version of Sony's QN1 ANC processor, it has 2 of them! Where the WH-1000XM4 had 4 microphones, the WH-1000XM5 has 8 microphones. Each updated Sony QN1 ANC processor has 4 microphones attached to it. Not only is that a dramatic improvement, you no longer have to start the ANC Optimization, as the WH-1000XM5 constantly monitors your environment & adjust the ANC to automatically block out nearly all noise!!! Further more it actually works extremely well! The WH-1000XM5 are nearly completely silent! They also support LDAC via Bluetooth with ANC & they sound phenomenal!
Now I actually did buy all of these myself, trust me I wish Sony would let me test and/or review these things!

Jonathan Merlini,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm worried these headphones weren't tested with PCs or computers. They work great with a phone and if you're only going to use them with a phone I highly recommend them. Unfortunately, if you use them elsewhere, they doesn't work as well.
The most aggravating thing is whenever I take my headphones off during a zoom meeting (this includes adjusting the headphones or removing one ear), it disconnects the zoom audio from the headphones somehow. So when I put the headphones back on, I have to disconnect and reconnect the headphones in order to hear and talk. This doesn't seem too bad until you're having to do it every meeting and having to explain to your coworkers ""my headphones disconnected again"".
The next complaint is that the headphones will randomly turn off when on desktop. I think this is due to the headphones automatically turning off if they don't hear audio for a while and I think this is incompatible with desktop.
Lastly, I like the idea of being able to use Alexa on the headphones -- to just have a smart speaker on me. This only works when connected to a phone which is a limitation of needing to use the Alexa app. However, when on a desktop, I'll get a notification occasionally of ""Unable to connect to smart assistant"" when it should be context aware and turn off the smart assistant if not connected to the phone.

Kevin Phan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the XM3 and thought now would finally be a good time to upgrade. And the XM5s were only slightly better. I EQ my headphones, so after that, they both sounded good to me, so not a significant enough difference there. XM5s we're marginally more comfortable, but not enough to make a difference to me either.
The couple things that were much better was it's ability to auto pause when removing the headphones connect to 2 devices at once (XM3 doesn't have that), the ambient sound mode was so much better, and the headphones overall responsiveness to touch/button controls was much faster.
As for noise cancelling, I'm convinced that there is variation in noise cancellation strength between each individual pair of WH-1000XM5 headphones. I've watched videos of sound engineers doing noise-cancelling samples and graphically showing the XM5s beating out other headphones, including the XM3. So I know that objectively, the XM5s should have better noise cancelling than most competitors, especially the old XM3s. But I've compared them both on a plane, in a room filled with talking people, and outside when a bunch of cicadas were droning. The 2 are either on par or the XM3s slightly edge out the XM5s. Again, it's soooo close, but I expected new model to be leaps beyond the model 2 generations ago. But because I know the XM5s have to be better, the only conclusion I can draw is that there is random variation in ANC strength between individual headphones.

Jim Taylorville,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Bar is HIGH when a consumer is spending $400.00 for a pair of Cans. (headphones to some) While the sound quality is GREAT, Sony falls flat on their face with their current adaptation of what at least some of us require. Voice Prompts is one requirement. Pressing the NC/AMB button brings you back to the 1980's Gong Show. One gong equals this, two gongs, something else. Any Questions? Yes, how about a voice prompt reminding me what mode I am in like the $50.00 USD in-ear headphones I purchased and tried out! Hold On, the 5's have Quick Access Buttons that YOU can set up. Great, let's go there. It's a quick trip as a grand total of ONE selection is available! TWO different taps available, only one selection available, weeks after formal introduction of the cans, months since prerelease units available to early testers. I paid for mine, a more complete product would have been appreciated. We are an Alexa house, Alexa car, Alexa office, Alexa cell phone, well, you get the idea. Alexa integration with the 5's, while it works, is basic and needs work. When you ask Big A for example what time is it, the 5's mute the music as it should, yet another A device within earshot gives you the time, and then the 5's never resume playing your music you had playing until you ask Big A to do so. It should operate similar to the speak to text function. While hoping for some software updates (was a big one yesterday) I know I only have 29 days left for free return. Keep in mind these cans are NOT audiophile purist cans. They can't be.

James B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I think the sound quality is great for music, as long as you do not touch the equalizer. If you try to boost the bass or try any of the presets, the sound is just wrong. It’s not like adjusting the equalizer on an amp on your car stereo or something. The equalizer makes things sound distorted. I have a pair of headphones that I bought for $25 two years ago. Comparing them with these $400 headphones, the Sony headphones are marginally better in sound, not phenomenally, amazingly better, just a slight improvement.
The supposedly automated functions are not automatic. When I answer a call, many times I have to select that the audio goes to my headphones, so the person calling just gets silence until I can switch it over manually. Not a big deal if these headphones cost $30, but at $400, when they brag about doing everything so smoothly, that is a big deal. The headphones do not switch automatically from my iPhone to my iPad. I have to go into settings, unpair the headphones from one device, then go into the settings on the other device and pair them. Again, I can do this, but it is very annoying that the headphones don’t do it automatically. When I was out walking and set the headphones for more transparency, because I walk on a neighborhood street with some light traffic, the headphones repeatedly turned on noise cancellation when I didn’t ask for that. Not only is that annoying, it is potentially dangerous if I can’t hear an electric car sneaking up on me.
After a few days of use, new problems are arising. The app just completely stopped working, so I had to delete it and download it again. It will still say the headphones don’t exist while I am listening to them. The headphones will shut themselves off for no reason.
As far as cancellation of background noise when you are making calls or voice memos, yes, it does remove background noise. However, my voice sounds very synthesized and unnatural. I find my voice very unpleasantly unnatural when listening to voice memos I’ve made.
Battery life seems very good. I believe their stated hours of use is probably right and certainly sufficient.
I would not say they are so comfortable that I could wear them all day. They are comfortable enough, but I definitely feel them. I have had other headphones that I completely forgot I had them on because they were light and soft. These headphones don’t give me a headache, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, which they ought to be at that price. Also, they get hot after a while. You certainly wouldn’t want to wear them on a hot day. You can’t use them outside on a rainy day or on a hot day. You can only use them outdoors on certain sunny, breezy, cool days, so basically they are useless outdoors for most of the year.
A relatively minor issue, but I don’t like the smell of them. They smell like plastic even after a couple of days.
I will probably return them if a software update doesn’t fix a lot of the problems. I don’t have an extra $400 to waste on a toy. I bought these headphones believing they would work as advertised and that I would be able to work better in noisy environments and be more productive. So far, that has definitely not been the case.
The software updated. It took forever. Now the headphones are worse.

Now for the things that I don't like. I don't like that you can't fold them. I don't know who thought that would be good be idea but I definitely hate that you can't.
Volume: I'm coming from the XB900N series. Those headphones are like about 3 years old. You can definitely tell that the volume from these are not on par with those. If the volume from the N series produced a level 100 volume than these are are around 90. Maybe it's a good thing so people won't hurt their hearing but I do wish they were a little louder.
Bass: I know the N series is supposed to produce superior bass but I feel like the bass on these on these are perhaps a tad low. The difference between those 2 is huge. For people who don't care about bass this will not be a big deal but if you love bass perhaps these are not the best for you.

Kerry White,5.0 out of 5 stars,"How do you perfect something that’s already perfect? Well Sony did just that with the XM5. The previous model was as perfect as they come but Sony really out did themselves this time! The new design is more modern although some people might like the old design better since they collapse. The build material feels a little cheap for the price compared to the Apple cans but are super light weight and comfortable. The case is much smaller and easy to fit into a backpack.
The noise cancellation is top notch! About the same or slightly better than Apple’s. I can’t hear a thing with these cans on. Blocks out most of everything!
Audio quality is slightly different from the previous version. These aren’t as bass heavy and has a more wider soundstage and just sound more balanced. They still have plenty of bass and Sony gives you option to adjust settings via the App.
Overall very happy with these headphones! I switch back and forth between my Sony and Apple headphones but I think these might just be slightly better than Apple and a little cheaper as well! Worth the buy!",Verified Purchase,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2022"

Chris Pineo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These weren't bad but I returned them because they weren't better than what I already have.
The pics look better than the item. They don't look bad but they aren't great either. They feel a little cheap but seem durable enough.
Comfort was OK but the lack of padding on the headband and ear cups was disappointing and caused a bit of discomfort.
NC was really good as always. Sony has the lead in that category.
Sound was better at default settings than the XM4 but I have several options I prefer such as the Shure Aonic 50 (good out of the box with a class leading EQ) and the AirPods Max (I really like their sound signature but it isn't for everyone). The bass is a bit overwhelming and overrides the mids and highs (but not as much as the XM4). The EQ in Sony's class leading app improves the sound (for an easy adjustment I recommend ""bright"" then adfjust to taste if needed) but not to the level of the other two options. To be fair if you like the Sony XM sound you'll like these as it's an improved version of it.

I own both AirPods Max and the older Sony 1000XM3s and both of these headsets have their strengths. I was hoping that with all the hype the 1000XM5s would be substantially better than the AirPods Max.
The biggest complaint is that when touching the ear cup on the Sonys you can easily hear it, the same action on the AirPod Max is minimal.
Both headsets have excellent audio, with the Max edging out the XM5s.

Also the pad at the middle for your scalp has crumbled into a mess - So I decided to purchase something new.
These headphones are lighter, are a lighter fit on my ears. They seem to be pretty decent overall - sound is good, noise canx is good. The only thing I really want is a toggle switch to go forward or backward on songs or audible. That's the only point I don't like.

Richard N. Barg,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I own the XM4s and Bose QC-35s. First, it should be said the XM4s are superior to the Bose QC-35s in comfort, sound and ANC. I only use the Bose in bad weather because it has manual buttons.
The design of the XM5 is a radical departure. Sony opted to provide less padding between the the headband and the top of the head. For sensitive users, like myself, there is a feeling of a bump on the top of the head which is annoying. These headphones also fit tighter, i.e., more clamping pressure.
Simply put, to this user, they are noticeably less comfortable as the XM4s to wear. Overall I was very satsified with my XM4s, but I received a unit where the auto-shutoff did not work and therefore tried the newer XM5s. With the XM5s, I was constantly fiddling with them to get the elusive comfortable feel. With the XM4s, I just put them on and they fit like a glove.
The XM5s are better than the XM4s in many other ways (8 microphones etc), but for me, comfort is king, something I won't compromise on. Sony copied the non-folding style of the Bose 700s. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

ToastersMakeTea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Continues on a bit of a muddy sound like the previous models, however the noise cancelling is superb and EQ options such as the custom Wavelet profile from soundguys make this an incredible all around headphone.
Edit: After owning this for a few days I've noticed some issues. Clicking on left channel when I move my head, ANC clipping occasionally when in a loud vehicle, and pads seem to wear in more quickly than other headphones. I still am impressed by the otherwise excellent performance, however i am getting an exchange and will update again soon.
Edit 2: Replacement unit has no audible issues. However i have noticed that after a very short amount of time the pads deform permanently. This is likely due to the (probably) low density foam used, and could be detrimental to sound quality in the long term.
Edit 3: Accidentally put a little too much force when squeezing these into a bag, the bracket held to the band by a single screw and some adhesive kinda just fell apart. Pushed it back together but there's a small gap there now. Maybe this headband isn't so well built.

Ryan P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are only slightly more comfortable than the XM4, however they tend to let sound in and come off my ears when I moved my head around. I have a relatively large head so that may not be an issue for you. The foam padding could definitely be a bit denser as it does deform easily.
My biggest problem was that they had issues connecting to my Bluetooth receiver I bought for my TV. I frequently had to turn them on, then off, then back on. This may be fixed further down the road with a software update.
I will say the sound is cleaner than the XM4 and sounds a bit more natural and well rounded somehow. I am not an expert on audio but it definitely sounds a tad bit cleaner. I had to get used to the XM4s sound profile again when I ended up returning these but they are still a great headset.
I think these could be 5 star with some better earpads and some software updates, especially if you dig the cleaner less bassy sound profile.

Onur Baykal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved. I actually disagree with many of the editors reviews, it's much better that it doesn't fold twice, the case is much thinner to transport. This also helps make the headphones much more durable overall.
In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones. Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones. The improvements here are well justified for an upgrade. Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the ""excited"" EQ setting in the companion app settings.
Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant. If you're coming from the previous generation model, the differences are immediately noticable.
The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair. It's justified.

As for ANC, no longer need to ""optimize"" as it auto optimizes depending on your surroundings. If you, like me, like to wear these headphones just to cancel sound and not play anything, you'll notice the auto ANC working it's magic. Definitely better than the XM4.

Aaron,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, not worth this price point.
Got these to replace my lost Bose QuietComfort 35s, and I can't help but feel these are basically a downgrade in every way. In terms of sound quality, I am not an audiophile but I feel this is the one area where they are at least equal, everything else is a wash.
- Noise Cancelling. Not the best. I can hear background music at my gym OVER my podcasts, while my Bose headphones were silent even without anything playing on them. I've also noticed this odd feeling when using noise cancelling, almost like a pressure on the inside of my ears.
- Ergonomics. These fit over the ears too loosely for me which means any sort of movement and they lose the seal over the ears.
- Privacy. Unlike my Bose headphones which I never needed to install an app for, these headphones features are very much reliant on their app. The app drains your battery and tracks you everywhere if you let it. There's even an option on the app to send Sony a picture of your ears to improve sound quality (i guess?) which is bizarre and ridiculous.
- Touch controls. Here is my biggest complaint. You have to swipe the side of the headphones to control playback. It is (of course) extremely easy to brush up against the side of your headphones. So either don't use these moving around the house (cleaning, etc.) or disable the touch controls and lose the ability to control playback on the headphones. Why did they think this was a good idea?
- Bluetooth connectivity. I've noticed that even with my phone in my pocket, the bluetooth signal can go out on these often. Playback will randomly pause for no reason as well (unsure if this is because of bluetooth or the touch controls being faulty due to sweat or something?).",Verified Purchase,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022"
Okeima Obialor,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure if the issues is that my unit is just faulty or if it's a common trend of this exact product. After spending about $400 on a headset, you will think it should be good right out the box but it's not. I have had better experiences with headset 1/3 of the price.
1. My unit goes in and out of ANC (active noise canceling) without touching the audio source, in this case my phone, laptop or other devices. It also does this on calls without the ANC being on, it turns it self on.
2. I had to turn off all gestures or control because the headphones kept stopping my music or video every few minutes when in use.
3. The sound, mic and ANC when it works are okay but I don't think these are worth all the issues that comes right out the box with the headset.
I'm not sure if this headphones have an update that will fix these issues but my experience has been absolutely horrible given I spent so much money on the product. I will try to update it and see if that changes anything but I don't think so.

Saint Loup,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset is almost perfect for my needs. They are light and can be on for hours without too much discomfort and the battery life is ridiculous. Why does it matter? Because I needed them on my flight to Europe to be able to listen to downloaded movies. Noise reduction in the airplane ended up being much more than 95%… you heard that right :) to me it felt like almost complete noise reduction, so much that I could hear my breathing and could lower the overall sound levels to below 50%. In my hotel room, noise reduction was close to 100%… I had to turn off the ANR to hear the loud air conditioner again. Better than some sound isolation phone booths!

As far as wireless travel headphones go, these are the best I've ever heard.

motoless,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed to replace the Bose nc700 I had and thought these new Sony's would be fantastic given all the hype and praise.
My use case is all day (off and on 10hours) wearing bouncing back and forth between calls and music. And traveling, I them literally everywhere- bus, plane, train, etc. I have premium wires headphones for ""real"" listening, but still desire hi quality wireless.
So, to get the negatives out of the way.
My hopes were improved audio and better comfort.
I found them to be more comfortable then my Bose for long term wearing and lots of moving around. Which was great. Except, they had a difficult time keeping a seal. Even sitting at my desk I would move around and notice outside sound suddenly leaking in. It wasnt very much, but still distracting . Maybe the padding is too thin.
Next, I immediately noticed the noise cancelling was not as good. I know Bose is king in that department, but the reviews were so glowing and nearly as good. What I heard was significantly...not as good.
In terms of audio quality. LDAC is a joke unless you have a dedicated Bluetooth transmitter device supporting it. LDAC has 4 different modes not usually visible in Android. The Sony app lets you manually chang between connection quality (basically makes LDAC the same as SBC ) and sound quality. Optimizing for sound quality, is totally unstable and the sound immediately has pops, stuttering, and other artifacts. Doesn't matter how close or. Far my phone is to the headphones. Tried multiple phones.
FYI Sony created LDAC. If they want to pump it as being the best souding Bluetooth option they need to work with developers.
Besides the LDAC fiasco. The bass sounds so weird when you turn up the ""clearbass"". Which automatically gets turned up on a lot of EQ presets. Did not like. I love bass, and listen to a wide variety of electronic, classical, and jazz. And that was one of the selling points to me from reviews is that people say Sony has warmer bass feel.
So, I end up with headphones that are unlistenable at high quality setting, and sound worse than my Bose.
I returned them, heartbroken.
Since then, I have some new Anker in ear wireless buds with ANC that sound better. I still need actual headphones, so I guess I'll wait for the Sennheiser 4 coming out in August and try them.",Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2022"
Erin Miller,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had these a month and wear them every day for work for teams meetings. The sound is amazing, noise cancelling spot on, but the product manager blew it on one thing. They didn't put a mute/unmute function on these. Sony's answer is to unmute in the application. So if you are on a teams meeting and are cooking lunch of course you will have yourself muted. The noise cancelling is good, but banging pots and pans will still come through somewhat. Or what if I want to say something to my wife while on the call? The range on the blue tooth is amazing which just means you have further to run back to your laptop to unmute. This is a complete pain in the you know what. So, if you are buying these for a plane only, go for it. I would submit that you don't need $400 headphones for a plane, they all do adequate at cancelling white noise. You need this level of functionality for work. You also need a mute button for work.

Sitting at my office desk there is a fan above me, I can literally hear it BETTER when noise canceling is enabled. Without headphones on I can't hear it, but put XM5 on and I can it. I wondered if it was because XM5 was making other noise quieter the fan noise stood out more.. but no, go put on XM4 and cannot hear fan at all. Its just literally worse.
I've also noticed issue in bathroom. Has this exhaust fan in it. Never had issue with XM3/XM4 for last couple years. But with XM5 90% of the time it blocks it out, but once in awhile it doesn't.. can hear it like even go from blocking and then suddenly can hear it. All the automatic stuff is disabled in settings. Its like some firmware bug. Unsure why this is only place I really notice it.
I mean going from XM3 to XM4 things only got better, even if minor. Going from XM3/XM4 to XM5.. worse. Like strictly worse.
The headphones are different.. not being able to fold isn't a big deal to me, but while that feature was given up nothing was really added. All of them you can adjust headband length.. the XM3/XM4 get a little smaller than XM5 if you have a small head or something. I only notice because I have XM5 as smallest setting possible and it fits me, where as with XM3/XM4 I had them a few notches bigger.
Sound from XM5 is not noticabely better as far as I can tell.

I was hesitant to pay this kind of money, of course, but I read several professional reviews that raved about them. I will say right up front, I just couldn't hear any difference in the noise cancelling from my M4's. I gave my M4's to my partnerer who travels with me most of the time, so I am able to switch with her for comparison. I just can't hear a difference. But, I'm that guy who always wants the latest and the best in tech, so I thought I would be happy. Here's the thing. My new M5's are constantly shifting the noise canceling. I'm sitting on the plane listening to relaxing music and it is like they shift from canceling to ambient noise. It lasts for 5-10 seconds, then they shift back. It happend every 5 minutes or so. I have tried turning off adaptive sound control, but it doesn't make a difference. Unfortunately, I went a while without traveling right after I purchased these and so didn't really start experiencing this until a while after purchasing.

I recommend you go to a trusted audio review site now and read those instead of these Amazon reviews. Your experience is much more likely to mirror those than the negative reviews.
Amazing noise cancellation, great sound quality, and comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time. These have become my daily use headphones and I haven't given it a second thought.

Regina Arlene,3.0 out of 5 stars,Purchasing these Sony headphones I was very excited to receive them because I figured the brand says it all. However this was not the case with these. The noise cancelling worked just fine. They even had an ambient control which didn't do much for me. Both the volume and the bass with these headphones just weren't good enough to me. Then the voice assistant would activate pretty easily and I was not wanting to hear it. I used them at work for two days and was glad they had controls on the ears for skipping to the next song. Again not good because if my hair grazed over the ear part it would pause the song I was listening to. For $400 and the Sony name these are not worth it.

Asa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from the WH-1000XM3s I was expecting these to be a great upgrade in terms of comfort, sound quality, and ESPECIALLY noise canceling but unfortunately that's not the case. I've been satisfied with the XM5s in all ways but noise-canceling and Sony seem to have done their best to chase the rep of Apple's noise-canceling solution to their own detriment due to a MUCH worse implementation of auto noise canceling.
Unlike the 1000XM3s and XM4s, the XM5s no longer allow you to run the optimizer to adjust your noise-canceling yourself but instead opt for the poor ANC (auto noise canceling) to be the ONLY method of adjusting the noise-canceling level. I currently work from home and have ADHD which makes subtle noises and even basic conversation not relevant to what I'm working on a huge issue for my focus. I relied on my XM3s to provide the proper noise canceling (with or without music) that I needed to avoid distractions but the XM5s ANC solution can't hold a candle to the experience of just manually adjusting the noise-canceling yourself via the optimizer in the XM3s.
I can hear almost everything while they're on. It drowns out small annoyances like buzzes and hums from electronics but its effect on voices and sounds around the same decibel level as a casual conversation and above seems to be around 50% effective. I can still hear the typing of my keyboard, loud sounds outside, the TV show someone's watching down the hall, people talking around me, almost everything! I bought these and brought them with me as my main pair while traveling away from home and can't really work well due to the amount of noise that seeps through them.
I'm sure they're great for plane or car rides or traveling close to traffic but if you wanted a pair of noise-canceling headphones for every situation and not just the extremes that finally trigger the noise canceling on them just get a pair of Airpods Max. When I return these that's what I'm doing!",Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2022"

A massive difference is with the quality of the voice pickup, for calls and videos. The WH-1000XM3 were adequate at best, but I used other headphones for work calls. The XM5s? Crystal clear. I mean night-and-day compared to the older cans, and better even than the expensive work-focused headphones provided by my office. I've attached a video with a recording made using these WH-1000XM5 headphones to give you an idea.

Third downside is they are noticeable hotter on my ears sitting outside in 70 degree weather made my ears a lot hotter in an A/B comparison with the xm-4's.
All that being said, if Sony addressed the ANC issue and these were operating at their full potential 100% of the time I'd be willing to overlook everything else but the difference in ANC performance is HUGE between the 4's and the 5's and I mean to say that the 4's are far better...

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Cumbersome when compared to other noise cancelling headphones as well as HUGE case. The WH-1000XM4 case is very slim, sleek, and compact - something easily carried on a plane where one would expect to use it most. The WH-1000XM5 case is BULKY, oddly shaped, and definitely not something that can be easily carried on a plane and utilized. The main reason for this is that the headphones don't fold like the XM4's do which is a HUGE disadvantage in my opinion. I personally don't care for the on/off button either. Many other higher-end noise cancelling headphones utilize the tilting headphone as the on/off activation which is easy, efficient, and preserves the battery. And an app ... why on earth does one need an APP in order to use the headphones. The only thing these headphones really have going for them is their noise cancelling ability and battery life are good. The negatives far outweigh the positives for the XM5's.

I would say for the most part the headphones themselves aren’t bad. Good sound quality (is meant for other music streaming apps more than Apple Music which I use) and noise cancellation when it works is nice. But a lot of the features don’t work for me. The headphones automatically pause your music when you talk. And that includes singing. Don’t really get the point if this when you can just press a button and either pause the music or switch to ambient sound. Also the headphones seem to switch between ambient and noise canceling (and different types of noise canceling) at will, depending on what it thinks you are doing. My first subway ride was an absolute nightmare because it would keep switching on me between quiet listening and then being bombarded with loud wind and train noises. And I do not know how to change that part. It will choose its settings over what you want. It feels like the headphones are in control of me rather than the other way around.

Weather Boy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the gesture driven controls and the speak to talk features on these headphones. I also like the tap to Spotify feature. And it's about damn time that the headphones in this series support multipoint connection. But, like earlier editions in the series, the bass is simply intolerable. That is, the bass is so boomy and undefined that it's like having someone blow small puffs of air into your ear. The only solution is to drastically dial back the bass using the equalizer... but then you have treble-heavy audio. Even old versions of the comparable Bose headphones (QC 35, Series II) offer much more satisfying bass. So these Sony headphones are going back. I hope that Sony can fix this long-standing problem so that it's not a choice between features and listening experience.",Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2022"

Bigball17,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Bose qc 35 and was happy but wanted to get the new Sony xm5 because of the better nois cancellation.
1. Noise cancellation of the xm5 is actually outstanding good!
BUT
2. I experience maaaany times problems at the connection with different devices! I wasn't used to this at all!
3. Very often I got the feedback that the person who is having a call with me is hearing an echo. So it is necessary to turn down the volume very much to have a good call quality! I wasn't used to this at all!
3. When Inwas sitting in a hotel room I suddenly got a weird sound on the right part of my xm5. It turned out that I received a very quiet radio signal. I received it just at my desk and nowhere else but it wasn't possible to work with the xm5 anymore.
4. When I turn my head or when I'm chewing a gum while listening to music the sealings lose the connection to the head and I hear the surrounding noise. Very uncomfortable!
I'm definitely not happy with the xm5 and will try to send them back! Even if the noise cacellation is really very good!",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2022"

William,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall regret this purchase relative to bose.
Pros:
- Look good
- Sound quality is OK
Cons:
- Active Noise Cancelling is an absolute joke on these. My cheap Anker earbuds from 3 years ago are more effective at blocking everything from traffic noise to airplane noise. I did configure the app, and turned off the adaptive sound control so I ould keep Noise Cancelling always on. When I say it's bad, I mean I can still hear my air filter's low hum through them. When I wore them in the office, I could still hear almost everything (chatter, vacuums, AC, etc). Yes it was reduced in volume, but not even close to what you expect from such an expensive pair of headphones. Totally unacceptable.
- Bluetooth drops frequently
- Headphones don't auto-reconnect when you put them on. So they turn off and pause your videos when you take them off, but when you put them on, you have to play the ""power on, wait 30 seconds for it to connect, make sure it's working"" game. My $30 Anker headphones have this feature, so I expect my $400 Sony's to have it to!
- Headband is too tight. It irritates my jaw after a long time and despite watching youtube videos on adjusting them, I just find I can't get a comfortable setup with them. They feel very tight like they're pressing in on the sides of my head. Also, despite being light, the headband is very stiff, so you feel them on your head much more than heavier headphones like BeyerDynamics.
Overall, I would strongly recommend not buying these. Ignore the hype. When you're planning to spend this kind of cash, it's really worth it to just go to a store and try out a few sets of headphones to see for yourself before buying anything.
Update:
The microphone has started to randomly cut out in the middle of meetings and phone calls. I have to turn the headset off and on again to get the microphone to work and it takes a solid 2-3 minutes.

Z. Levin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"On Sept. 16 I wrote a review about a glitch with my M5's. Unprompted, they would shut off and on. While this issue is obviously unacceptable for $400 headphones, it is particularly problematic when on a call; the person you're speaking to suddenly can't hear you and you can't hear them. Also unprompted, the noise cancellation would shut off and on. Thinking it might just be a glitch unique to the pair I bought, and not seeing any critical reviews referencing this problem, I returned this pair and ordered new ones, which I received today. SAME EXACT ISSUE! Come on, people. Speak up. This has to be a pervasive issue with this iteration of M5's. (It is not a Bluetooth issue, as I am not losing my connection or pairing. If there is something I'm not thinking of, please advise.)

The headband in narrower than the XM3/4 and therefore more uncomfortable.

Not bad overall, but more expensive and more buggy than the previous model. Anyone thinking of buying this should save ~50 bucks and buy the 1000XM4.
EDIT: The disconnect thing is happening a LOT. It happened 4 times just today. This is tremendously annoying, and this is not what I paid 400 dollars for. The previous model never did this. On top of that, the companion app on my phone is also a tremendous source of irritation, the settings reset themselves constantly. I have to repeatedly turn off the 'Speak to activate' feature because otherwise when I say ANYTHING, the music pauses and Siri/Google/Whatever is trying to listen. I shouldn't have to repeatedly turn this off.

Suzanne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with. But whats the point of all this if the headphones are unbearable to wear?
I wear headphones almost every waking moment, and when it comes to being worn, they're a step down in every sense compared to the 1000Xm3 (and likely 1000xm4, they seem to be built the same).
The extending part of the headphones (whatever they're called) no longer extends by set amounts, which wouldn't be a problem if they stuck in place! The act of walking around itself causes the headphones to extend and become loose! Not that changes much because the most compact setting on these is too large for my head! The inside of the headphones rests on the helix of my ear, not the lobule, meaning they're pressing down my ears instead of resting on my head.
Now, lets say I want to put the headphones around my neck? Good luck feeling comfortable, unlike the xm3 and xm4, you can't rotate the heads on the headphones, meaning the hard outer plastic will be banging against your collarbone while you walk. This also means that if you turn your head too much, gaps appear between your head and the headphone, letting sound leak in. These headphones also lack the ability to fold in on themselves, which makes the most compact storage method for these headphones almost twice as large as for the xm3/4.
Please Sony, for the xm6 bring back the design you all were using for the xm3&4, it was amazing. The most ""inconvenient"" thing about them was how I'd never want to take them off because they were so comfortable. The xm5 so much worse to the xm3 I literally returned it only a couple of weeks after dealing with it, found my old half eaten (by our dog) xm3 and manually repaired them because these were just plain unbearable at times to wear.

Brian,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found my Beats Studio 3 headphones to perform better, unfortunately they broke [physical accident]. These headphones are definitely more comfortable, but that is all. For noise cancellation, they do a mediocre job when it comes to predictable noise (e.g fans or lawn mower). When it comes to less predictable noise (e.g. clanging dishes, hammering), they just don't cut it at all. Mine also seem to decide they are just going to turn themselves off while actively connected to a device and playing music. This is my second Sony product in a short period of time after not having bought from them for years, and I feel that they are not at the top of their game anymore, and will steer clear of their product in the future.
Nov 2022 Update:
These continue to disappoint at an epic level. With the latest September update, they continue to turn themselves off. I've found the touch sensitivity is so bad, if you are outside and happen to brush by a bush, it is enough to change settings. After a plane flight the other day, I found that they failed miserably there as well. Sure, they block out some noise, but not for what I paid - maybe 1/4 of what they are selling for. I am about to spend money that I shouldn't on a new pair of Apple headphones, because I am about to physically break these. I also tested them against a white noise machine that was 50 feet away, and they failed to block out this steady sound, even with music playing at a comfortable volume.
End of Nov 2022, and end of the headphones
I contacted Sony through chat, and they had me reset them. Then, all of the settings were disabled again. This did absolutely no good. The headphones continued to turn on/off the music, and turn on/off the level of sound control. I got so mad this morning that I ended up smashing/breaking them, so they are now in the trash.
Thanks a lot of this useless product/app/support Sony. Good riddance.",Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2022"

These headsets are either on my head or in the case, safely stowed away. I put them on/ take them off by grabbing the solid parts over the ears.

Eighty One,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not going to get into the details of how this thing's noise canceling works (you can research it online), but it has some dynamic noise canceling where it only toggles on the ""high"" power noise canceling when the headphones detect that there is loud noise happening around you. Even though there's an app that you can use to modify all sorts of other behavior with this headphone, you CANNOT control the noise canceling strength. So even if you wanted it to always have the high power noise canceling (which is the only good version, since the ""low"" power is not that effective), you can only have it on when the headphones decide you get to have it.
To make matters worse, the headphones don't even reliably shift between low/high noise canceling at appropriate times. The worst instance I experienced (which made me return these) was when I was cooking in the kitchen and had the oven range hood fan running. Obviously, this fan is going to make a lot of noise, so it should trigger the high power noise canceling -- which it did. However, the headphones kept switching between high/lower power noise canceling every 10-15 seconds, which made listening to them a really obnoxious experience (as you keep hearing outside noise toggling in an out constantly)!
Sony ruined what would have otherwise been the perfect noise canceling headphones. But, nobody seems be talking about this problem very much, which is a shame.

Natalie M,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the XM4s and returned them when I heard that the XM5s were being released, and I must say that I am deeply regretting it. I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that. Hate is a strong word but I am incredibly diappointed in these. I have a small head and most headphones hurt me due to to the clamp of the U shape, and the XM4s seemed to have a less pronounced curve so I could wear them comfortably for hours. After 5 minutes of the XM5s, they have to come off. The strong U-shape of the XM5s also makes it so that the cups don't sit flush to my ears, so I can feel the bottom of the earcup press into my head much more than the top. Also, the band at the top is so thin and round that it places extra pressure on the top of my head. At least on the XM4s, the band was wide so it helped distribute that pressure in a way that made the headphones feel weightless.
Another thing that I miss about the XM4s is that there was a clear diagram in the case showing where the controls were. I can't for the life of me figure out where that information is for the XM5s! It's not in the app, the tiny ""reference guide"" booklet, nor even on the internet.
Most reviews have already mentioned this but another gripe I have is that the XM5s don't fold and therefore the case is huge. As a person who travels frequently for work, this is a huge no-no for me. Seriously, what was Sony thinking?

Customer 12312412,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used the Xm3 headphones for years, but the aux plugin on them has recently stopped working, so I decided I would 'upgrade' to the newest version of the Xm series of headphones. Putting the quotation marks around 'upgrade' being very important here.
The noise cancelling on the Xm5's are 'adaptive' by default and you can't change or disable it. This means that if there is any change in noise around you whatsoever, these 'noise canceling' headphones will stop noise canceling and just blast your ears with the sounds coming from around you. This makes them completely useless for me because I have a loud air conditioner in my room. My Xm3's had no problem canceling out the noise, but these Xm5's stop canceling noise anytime it picks up any noise coming from me, such as the very, very, quiet sound of me swallowing, sipping water, talking to a mic, and sometimes even breathing.
The sound quality appears to be a downgrade from the Xm3's, but it is difficult to compare them fairly due to how terrible and intermittent the noise canceling on the Xm5's are.
I tried talking to customer support to see if there was a problem with the headphones or if there was some setting I didn't know about, but they just provided copy and past answers that provided no help then they tried to have me contact the Sony customer support in the UK.",Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022"

But all the youtubers that I watched told me that the XM5 were slightly more comfortable than the XM4s and the Airpods Max. But on me, the XM5s are UNcomfortable within an hour. I guess there's something wrong with me? Like seriously, what's with all the other 5 star reviews? I'm genuinely confused, is there something weird about my headshape? I don't have an especially huge noggin and I don't have protruding ears. On a bell curve of humans shapes, I'm pretty close to that typical, middle line. I felt comfortable in the previous XM models.
I must just be a bad person to disagree with the sponsored youtubers.
The most comfortable headphones I've ever used are the Bose QC35 ii. In fact, I'm wearing the Bose right now!
I actually felt relief when I switched to any of the other headsets I have from the XM5s.
There's also a weird ANC problem. I used the Sony app to turn OFF Adaptive ANC. In spite of that, when I'm near a fan, it seems to throw the ANC off. I can hear the fan loud and clear, then, slowly, the ANC settles back in. A problem that none of the other three headphones I have give me.

How these got out into production is baffling.
Absolute worst: the noise cancelling can't be set ""just On"". The silly ""adaptive"" sound cancellation ""feature"" constantly causes noise cancellation to turn on and off, at roughly 10 second intervals. It's very annoying, and causes lots of noise. Sony, PLEASE FIX THIS and allow it to just stay on full noise cancellation! What's the point of cancellation, if it can't be kept On?
Also absolute worst: there's a toxic plastic smell from the headphones, that none of the prior versions had. I've washed off all exposed parts, put it into the sun, etc, and still smell this strongly after 4 days. It's not diminishing at all. I have to use a fan to blow the smell away when I'm using these, it's so bad.
Also bad: at least three major bugs. Eg the onboard volume control doesn't work, and totally kills the volume when trying to decrease volume by even a tiny bit. The headphones constantly disconnect. Etc etc.

It did, however, push for the 360 sound that you have to pay a subscription for. Although the sound is better with the 360. It is not superior. My iPods have better sound without a subscription.
As far as noise cancellation, it worked the first time. After the 2nd day, that feature no longer worked.
You cannot wear the headphones and move around because it will automatically stop working.
I tried several times sitting still to listen to a guided meditation. After about 15 minutes, it automatically stops, disconnects and shuts off.

Anita Wagener,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose have been my go to head phones I actually sent the Bose 700 back because they were lacking in sound. The Sony xm5 sounds great and are comfortable but the the sensor control on right side only works half the time. I’m guessing I got a bad pair n will send them back and try again. Then I will update my review.
Update I’ve discovered why the headphones don’t consistently work. I’m bald and wear a lot of hats I discovered that when I wear a hat like a baseball hat or a skullcap the headphones actually shut of or the functions such as volume, fast forward etc.. don’t work. . I’ve experiment with taking my hat on n off many times. my belief is the headphones sensors are so sensitive that when I wear a hat the headphone thinks I’m not wearing The headphones and then shuts it off or it thinks I took the headphones off my head and therefore the controls don’t work I’m really disappointed because I really want to keep them I’m probably gonna send them back .

The build quality seems really nice. I think they are slim and fashionable (for what they are). I will not be returning these (I bought them somewhere that ships quickly). Ok, that is out of the way. They are too expensive simply because their sound quality is .. so so. They have this extra 360 reality audio feature that they showcase briefly during setup... and that stuff sounded really good. But... but.... it is subscription only to get content... so I won't be trying that. I tried playing with the equalizer (which was refreshingly easy), but no buino. The sound quality just is a big disappointment. I am NOT an audiophile snob. I appreciate music that just makes me feel good. I know some audiophile snobs, and I respect them. Yes, I can hear a difference from $10,000 speakers relative to $2000 speakers. But I would always choose the 2k version. That said... I just can't bury myself into the music with these headphones no matter what I try. I'm really really disappointed. However... they are amazing for talking on video conferencing. They do noise cancelling really well. The feature set and build quality are really quite good.... so I am going to keep these and use them on my working trip. I really wish they were $150 dollars less for what I am getting. But I am not dinging the product for value. Only for the sound quality. Honestly, I have a pair of ankers that I think are as good sound quality, and they were a lot cheaper. but the features in that kind of sucked. So... don't believe the hype.

Michelle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones. As someone with glasses, they don't hurt my ears or feel like I have even more pressure while wearing them which is something I'm always looking for. Sound is nice I like how the app lets you adjust the sound with preset mods and your own customizable mod. The touchpad is easy to use after you get used to it I wish the volume wouldn't just go down or up by one but you get over that pretty easily. Noise cancelation is good it works nice and reduces smaller to medium noises and voice, it struggles a bit with louder ones but it still works fine outside in noisy settings. The amplified noise is good as well it struggles a bit with smaller noises, but I'm okay with that I'm not trying to hear that manly those bigger noises if I'm on the sidewalk or outside. The quick amplification is good too it's fast and loud enough to hear everything. The app lets it be adjustable as well which is nice and allows for all noises or voices only options. The mics too are nice they sound good in videos, audio messages, and on phone calls. The only issue I have is the headband. While it is cushioned it hurts to have them on after an hour or two of using them constantly and makes you want to take them off to rest your head. Which can be upsetting when you're trying to study, work, edit, or just watch a movie or something. It's truly disappointing because the headphones are nice except for that part.
